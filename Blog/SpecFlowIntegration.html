    <p>The <a href="http://specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a> team recently 
    released version 1.7 and with it they included 
    <a href="http://gasparnagy.blogspot.com/2011/08/enhanced-upgrading-options-in-specflow.html"
    >support for SharpDevelop 4.0</a>. SpecFlow is an open source 
    framework that you can use to do 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development">
    Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)</a> on .NET. It allows you to 
    bind business requirements to the code. Let us take a look at how 
    SpecFlow integrates with SharpDevelop.</p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>Download and install the following:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sharpdevelop/files/SharpDevelop%204.x/4.0/SharpDevelop_4.0.0.7070_Setup.msi/download"
      >SharpDevelop 4.0</a></li>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/downloads"
      >SpecFlow 1.7.0</a></li>

    </ol>

    <p>If SharpDevelop is installed first then the SpecFlow installer 
    will  detect SharpDevelop, as shown in the screenshot below.</p>

    <p><img alt="SpecFlow installer detecting SharpDevelop 4.0"
     src="Images/SpecflowSetupDialogDetectedSharpDevelop4.png"/></p>

    <p>The installer will then add a set of SpecFlow templates to 
    SharpDevelop. It will also install a SharpDevelop addin which you 
    will need to register using the addin manager. To register the 
    SpecFlow addin start SharpDevelop and from the Tools menu select 
    AddIn Manager. This will open the AddIn Manager dialog.</p>

    <p><img alt="AddIn Manager dialog"
     src="Images/AddInManagerDialogInSharpDevelop4.png"/></p>

    <p>Click the Install AddIn button and browse to the SpecFlow 
    installation folder. The default installation folder for SpecFlow 
    is <b>C:\Program Files\TechTalk\SpecFlow</b>. In this folder find 
    the <b>TechTalk.SpecFlow.SharpDevelop4Integration.addin</b> file, 
    select it and click the Open button. The SpecFlow addin should then 
    be displayed in the AddIn Manager dialog.</p>

    <p><img alt="SpecFlow addin installed in SharpDevelop 4.0"
     src="Images/SpecFlowAddInInstalledInSharpDevelop4.png"/></p>

    <p>Restart SharpDevelop so the SpecFlow addin is loaded and is 
    ready to be used.</p>

    <p>Now let us take a look at how to use SpecFlow with 
    SharpDevelop.</p>

    <h2>Using SpecFlow</h2>

    <p>Here we will follow the 
    <a href="http://specflow.org/specflow/workflow.aspx">workflow</a> 
    that is shown on the SpecFlow web site. This workflow looks at 
    creating a bowling game using SpecFlow.</p>

    <p>In SharpDevelop create a new C# class library project called 
    Bowling. Right click the project just created and select Add New 
    Item. In the New File dialog open the <b>SpecFlow</b> category and 
    select the <b>SpecFlow Feature</b> template. Change the filename to 
    be ScoreCalculation.feature. Click the Create button to save the 
    file.</p>

    <p><img alt="SpecFlow feature file template in New File Dialog"
     src="Images/SpecFlowFeatureFileTemplateInNewFileDialog.png"/></p>

    <p>Replace the existing text in the feature file created with the 
    text shown below.</p>

    <pre>Feature: Score Calculation 
 In order to know my performance 
 As a player 
 I want the system to calculate my total score 
 
Scenario: Gutter Game 
 Given a new bowling game 
 When all of my balls are landing in the gutter 
 Then my total score should be 0 
 
Scenario: All Strikes 
 Given a new bowling game 
 When all of my rolls are strikes 
 Then my total score should be 300</pre>
    <p>This is the specification for one part of the game. It is 
    written in a language called 
    <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin">
    Gherkin</a> which gives you a user friendly way to specify a set of 
    behaviours that your application should have. More information 
    about the Gherkin language can be found on the 
    <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin">Gherkin 
    wiki</a>.</p>

    <p>Now select this feature file in the Projects window, right click 
    and select Properties. In the file properties change the Custom 
    Tool to be <b>SpecFlowSingleFileGenerator</b>.</p>

    <p>
    <img alt="SpecFlowSingleFileGenerator custom tool set in file properties"
     src="Images/SpecFlowSingleFileGeneratorCustomToolSetInFileProperties.png"/></p>

    <p>Now every time you save the feature file a new file will be 
    auto-generated.</p>

    <p><img alt="ScoreCalculation.feature.cs generated file."
     src="Images/SpecFlowSingleFileGeneratorCustomToolGeneratedFileInProjectsWindow.png"/></p>

    <p>If you open this generated file you will see that it contains a 
    class that has two NUnit tests.</p>

    <p><img alt="Generated file with NUnit tests."
     src="Images/SpecFlowSingleFileGeneratorCustomToolGeneratedFileContents.png"/></p>

    <p>To run the unit tests you will need to add a reference to NUnit 
    and SpecFlow to the project. In the Projects window, right click 
    your project and select Add Reference. Select the .NET Assembly 
    Browser tab and browse to the NUnit.Framework.dll file that can be 
    found in the SharpDevelop folder C:\Program 
    Files\SharpDevelop\4.0\bin\Tools\NUnit and add that file as a 
    reference. Do the same for the TechTalk.SpecFlow.dll file which can 
    be found in the C:\Program Files\TechTalk\SpecFlow folder.</p>

    <p>Now create a new file called BowlingSteps.cs and copy the 
    following code into it.</p>

    <pre>using System; 
using NUnit.Framework; 
using TechTalk.SpecFlow; 
 
namespace Bowling 
{ 
 
 [Binding] 
 public class BowlingSteps 
 { 
  private Game _game; 
 
  [Given(@&quot;a new bowling game&quot;)] 
  public void GivenANewBowlingGame() 
  { 
   _game = new Game(); 
  } 
 
  [When(@&quot;all of my balls are landing in the gutter&quot;)] 
  public void WhenAllOfMyBallsAreLandingInTheGutter() 
  { 
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++) 
   { 
    _game.Roll(0); 
   } 
  } 
 
  [When(@&quot;all of my rolls are strikes&quot;)] 
  public void WhenAllOfMyRollsAreStrikes() 
  { 
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; 12; i++) 
   { 
    _game.Roll(10); 
   } 
  } 
 
  [Then(@&quot;my total score should be (\d+)&quot;)] 
  public void ThenMyTotalScoreShouldBe(int score) 
  { 
   Assert.AreEqual(score, _game.Score); 
  } 
 
  [When(@&quot;I roll (\d+)&quot;)] 
  public void WhenIRoll(int pins) 
  { 
   _game.Roll(pins); 
  } 
 
  [When(@&quot;I roll (\d+) and (\d+)&quot;)] 
  public void WhenIRoll(int pins1, int pins2) 
  { 
   _game.Roll(pins1); 
   _game.Roll(pins2); 
  }  
 
  [When(@&quot;I roll (\d+) times (\d+) and (\d+)&quot;)] 
  public void WhenIRollSeveralTimes2(int rollCount, int pins1, int pins2) 
  { 
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; rollCount; i++) 
   { 
    _game.Roll(pins1); 
    _game.Roll(pins2); 
   } 
  } 
 
  [When(@&quot;I roll the following series:(.*)&quot;)] 
  public void WhenIRollTheFollowingSeries(string series) 
  { 
   foreach (var roll in series.Trim().Split(&apos;,&apos;)) 
   { 
    _game.Roll(int.Parse(roll)); 
   } 
  } 
 
  [When(@&quot;I roll&quot;)] 
  public void WhenIRoll(Table rolls) 
  { 
   foreach (var row in rolls.Rows) 
   { 
    _game.Roll(int.Parse(row[&quot;Pins&quot;])); 
   } 
  } 
 } 
}</pre>
    <p>The BowlingSteps.cs file shown above implements the scenarios 
    defined in the feature file and will be used by the unit tests to 
    verify the implementation works as expected.</p>

    <p>The only bit that is missing is the code that implements the 
    bowling game logic. Create a file called Game.cs and copy the code 
    shown into it.</p>

    <pre>namespace Bowling 
{ 
 public class Game 
 { 
  public void Roll(int i) 
  {     
  } 
   
  public int Score {  
   get { return -1; } 
  } 
 } 
} 
</pre>
    <p>The Game.cs file contains the main Game class that implements 
    the logic that we are going to test. Currently this code is 
    incorrect so we are expecting the unit tests to fail.</p>

    <p>In the Unit Tests window (View | Tools | Unit Tests) click the 
    Run all tests toolbar button. All the tests should fail as shown 
    below.</p>

    <p><img alt="All specflow unit tests failed."
     src="Images/SpecFlowUnitTestsAllFailed.png"/></p>

    <p>Now we need to fix the tests. The GutterGame test is the easiest 
    to get working. Edit the Game class and change the Score property 
    so it returns 0.</p>

    <pre>namespace Bowling 
{ 
 public class Game 
 { 
  public void Roll(int i) 
  { 
  } 
   
  public int Score {  
   get { return 0; } 
  } 
 } 
}</pre>
    <p>Now when you run the unit tests again the GutterGame test will 
    pass.</p>

    <p><img alt="SpecFlow gutter game unit test passes"
     src="Images/SpecFlowUnitTestsGutterGameTestPassed.png"/></p>

    <p>The next step would be to change the Game class so the 
    AllStrikes unit test will pass. Then you could define more 
    scenarios in feature files to cover more functionality that you 
    want the bowling game to have. Then you would go through the 
    process just described until you have a working solution that meets 
    all the requirements. These steps are not shown here but hopefully 
    you get the idea.</p>

    <p>We have looked at how SpecFlow integrates with SharpDevelop and 
    walked through the process of defining a set of scenarios that our 
    application should have, creating unit tests to check the scenarios 
    are implemented correctly and finally implementing the application 
    logic so the unit tests pass.</p>

    <title>Configuring File Associations in the Installer</title>

  </head>

  <body>

    <p>The installer for SharpDevelop 2.1, from revision 2245 onwards, 
    now allows you to configure the file associations that are created. 
    Previously the installer would register them 
    without asking and you would lose any file associations that Visual 
    Studio had previously set up.</p>

    <p>When you install SharpDevelop you will now be presented with a 
    dialog containing a feature tree.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/InstallerWithFeatureTree.png"/></p>

    <p>Expand the <b>File Associations</b> feature to see the list of 
    file associations that will be created by default.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/InstallerFileAssocsExpanded.png"/></p>

    <p>From this dialog you can stop the installer from registering any 
    file associations or you can disable individual file associations. 
    To stop the installer from registering any associations, right 
    click <b>File Associations</b> and select <b>Entire feature will be 
    unavailable</b>.</p>

    <p>Disabled file associations will then be marked with a red 
    cross.</p>

    <p>Individual file associations can be selected and disabled in the 
    same way.</p>

    <p>Here is a walkthrough on how to compile Python packages and 
    modules, such as those provided by the 
    <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/">Python Standard 
    Library</a>, so you can distribute your IronPython application as a 
    set of standalone assemblies. If you just want to use the Python 
    Standard Library without compiling parts of it into your 
    application then you can add the path to the standard library as 
    described in a previous post on 
    <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2009/03/01/UsingPythonStandardLibrary.aspx"
    >using the Python Standard Library</a>.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

    <p>You will need to have SharpDevelop 3.2 and Python 2.6 installed 
    on your machine. These can be downloaded from the following 
    locations.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>
      <a href="http://www.sharpdevelop.net/OpenSource/SD/Download/#SharpDevelop30"
      >SharpDevelop 3.2</a></li>

      <li><a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.4/"
      >Python 2.6</a></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Python Modules Included with IronPython</h2>

    <p>Before you start compiling a Python module or package into your 
    application you should check whether it is already included with 
    IronPython or whether you can use the .NET framework instead. A lot 
    of the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/">Python Standard 
    Library</a> modules are already included with IronPython. You can 
    see which ones by using 
    <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/">Reflector</a> 
    to look at IronPython.dll and IronPython.Modules.dll. Open these 
    assemblies in Reflector, right click and select Disassemble. In the 
    screenshot below the modules that are included with IronPython are 
    defined by the PythonModule attribute.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/IronPythonModulesInReflector.png"/></p>

    <p>Alternatively you can use the 
    <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/Python/IronPythonModulesReader.zip"
    >IronPython Modules Reader application</a> to list all the 
    available modules in IronPython.</p>

    <p>If you need to use one of the modules provided by IronPython 
    then add a reference to IronPython and IronPython.Modules in your 
    project and then import the module in the normal way:</p>

    <pre>import cmath</pre>
    <h2>Compiling a Python Module</h2>

    <p>Now we will look at writing a simple IronPython application that 
    reads in a zip file using the zipfile module from the Python 
    standard library. Our application will read the names of all the 
    files in the zip file and display them in the console window. The 
    code is shown below.</p>

    <pre>import zipfile 
 
file = zipfile.ZipFile(&quot;test.zip&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) 
 
for name in file.namelist(): 
    print name
</pre>
    <p>Now if you create a python console project with SharpDevelop, 
    copy the code above into the Program.py file, compile and run the 
    program you will get an error saying &quot;No module called 
    zipfile&quot;. To fix this problem you can add the zipfile.py file 
    from the Python standard library directly into your project. Simply 
    right click your project, select Add Existing Item and browse to 
    the zipfile in the python libs folder (e.g. C:\Python26\lib). If 
    you compile your program again and run it you will get an error 
    about a different module. The zipfile module depends on 13 other 
    modules from the standard library. With a bit of trial and error 
    you can work out which modules are needed. After adding these 
    dependent modules to your project you will have a set of assemblies 
    that do not require the Python Standard library to be installed.</p>

    <p>The full code for the zip file reader application can be 
    downloaded from the 
    <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/Python/ZipFileReader.zip"
    >Zip File Reader</a> link at the end of this post.</p>

    <h2>Compiling a Python Package</h2>

    <p>A Python module consists of a single file (e.g. zipfile.py). A 
    Python package is a set of files inside a subdirectory. Compiling a 
    package into your application cannot be done simply by including 
    the files directly in your project. Instead you must compile the 
    package files into a separate class library assembly. As an example 
    we will look at using the json package. We will create a simple 
    application that creates a json string from a dictionary. The code 
    is shown below.</p>

    <pre>import json 
 
address = {} 
address[&quot;street&quot;] = &quot;24 22nd Street&quot; 
address[&quot;city&quot;] = &quot;New York&quot; 
address[&quot;state&quot;] = &quot;NY&quot; 
address[&quot;postCode&quot;] = &quot;10021&quot; 
 
person = {} 
person[&quot;firstName&quot;] = &quot;John&quot; 
person[&quot;lastName&quot;] = &quot;Smith&quot; 
person[&quot;age&quot;] = 20 
person[&quot;address&quot;] = address 
 
print json.dumps(person)</pre>
    <p>Now to use the json package from our application we need to 
    create a python class library project. Then we need to add all the 
    files from the json package into this project and compile it. 
    Finally in our Json Writer project we need to add a reference to 
    this class library. The screenshot below shows the contents of the 
    two projects.</p>

    <p><img alt="Json package in class library"
     src="Images/JsonPackageInPythonClassLibraryProject.png"/></p>

    <p>Now this is not quite enough since the json package depends on 
    several modules in the standard library. So now we add these to the 
    json class library project. After adding these modules the json 
    class library project should then contain the files as shown in the 
    screenshot below.</p>

    <p><img alt="Json class library with dependencies"
     src="Images/JsonPackageWithDependenciesInPythonClassLibraryProject.png"/></p>

    <p>You should now be able to compile and run your Json Writer 
    application. The Json Writer application can now be distributed as 
    a set of assemblies without needing the Python Standard Library to 
    be installed.</p>

    <p>The full code for the Json Writer application can be downloaded 
    from the 
    <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/Python/JsonWriter.zip"
    >Json Writer</a> link at the end of this post.</p>

    <p>Finally here is a link to the 
    <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundationLicenseFaq"
    >license FAQ for Python and Python Standard Library</a> that should 
    be checked before you include the standard library in your 
    application.</p>

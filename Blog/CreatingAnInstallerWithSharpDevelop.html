    <title>Creating an Installer with SharpDevelop</title>

    <link href="../Help/css/help.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>

  </head>

  <body>

    <p>This tutorial will walk you through creating an installer from 
    scratch using the integrated <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net">
    WiX</a> support included with SharpDevelop 2.1.</p>

    <p>The installer that will be created is a real-world example and 
    was used by <a href="http://chrison.net">Christoph Wille</a> as the 
    starting point for his 
    <a href=" http://chrison.net/CCCP12AvailableWithSetup.aspx">Code 
    Comment Checking Policy for Visual Studio Team System</a> 
    installer.</p>

    <p>Please note that you will need a recent version of 
    <a href="http://build.sharpdevelop.net/BuildArtefacts/">
    SharpDevelop 2.1</a> to follow this walkthrough. In beta 3 any 
    changes made to the WiX project&apos;s options are incorrectly 
    encoded on saving. This prevents the project from being 
    compiled.</p>

    <h2>Installer Requirements</h2>

    <p>First, what does our installer need to do?</p>

    <table>

      <thead>

        <tr>

          <th>Item</th>

          <th>Description</th>

        </tr>

      </thead>

      <tr>

        <td>cccppol.dll (.NET assembly)</td>

        <td>To be installed in Program Files.</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

        <td>ICSharpCode.CCCPLib.dll (.NET assembly)</td>

        <td>To be installed in the GAC</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

        <td>ICSharpCode.NRefactory.dll (.NET assembly)</td>

        <td>To be installed in the GAC</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

        <td>ICSharpCode.SharpDevelop.Dom.dll (.NET assembly)</td>

        <td>To be installed in the GAC</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

        <td>

          Registry key: 
          HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\TeamFoundation\SourceControl\Checkin 
          Policies
          <p>Registry value name: cccppol</p>

        </td>

        <td>The registry value cccppol should contain the full path to 
        the cccppol.dll assembly.</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

        <td>License Information</td>

        <td>The installer should show the license information in one of 
        its dialogs.</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

        <td>Installation Directory</td>

        <td>The installer should allow the user to select where the 
        cccppol file is to be installed. The default should be 
        &quot;C:\Program Files\Cccp Policy&quot;</td>

      </tr>

    </table>

    <p>It has four .NET assemblies to install. Three of which are to be 
    registered in the GAC. It needs to create one registry key that 
    points to the cccppol.dll file. The installer UI needs to show 
    license information and allow you to choose the directory where the 
    cccppol.dll file will be installed. Now let&apos;s create our 
    installer.</p>

    <h2>Creating a New Setup Project</h2>

    <p>To create a new WiX setup project, from the <b>File</b> menu, 
    select <b>New</b> and then select <b>Solution...</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="Menu option to create a new solution"
     src="../Help/Images/FileNewSolutionMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>This opens the <b>New Project</b> dialog box.</p>

    <p><img alt="New Project dialog"
     src="Images/CreateNewCccpSetupProject.png"/></p>

    <p>Select the <b>Setup</b> category and then select <b>Empty Setup 
    Project</b> from the list of available templates. We are going to 
    use the empty project and try to keep the setup as simple as 
    possible using as much of the functionality that WiX provides for 
    us. Give the setup project a name and choose a location for it to 
    be saved. Finally click the <b>Create</b> button.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/NewEmptySetupProjectFiles.png"/></p>

    <p>The empty setup project contains very little, just one Setup.wxs 
    file, which is where we will start. At the moment the project will 
    not compile, so let us fix that. First give your 
    <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/manual-wix2/wix_xsd_product.htm"
    >product</a> a name and a manufacturer.</p>

    <div id="xml">

      <pre> &lt;Product Id=&quot;8F3A52FE-BB54-4BC9-953C-7173D16AA96D&quot; 
  Name=&quot;<b>Code Comment Checking Policy</b>&quot; 
  Language=&quot;1033&quot; 
  Version=&quot;1.0.0.0&quot; 
  Manufacturer=&quot;<b>ic#code</b>&quot;&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    <p>Then give your 
    <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/manual-wix2/wix_xsd_package.htm"
    >package</a> a description.</p>

    <div id="xml">

      <pre> &lt;Package Id=&quot;A970C90A-3EFD-4121-B92D-2D0454643B38&quot; 
  Description=&quot;<b>Installs Code Comment Checking Policy for VSTS</b>&quot; 
  Comments=&quot;Comments&quot; 
  InstallerVersion=&quot;200&quot; 
  Compressed=&quot;yes&quot; 
 /&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Preparing to Add Files</h2>

    <p>Before we add the four files to the installer we need to add a 
    few extra bits to Setup.wxs. First we add a 
    <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/manual-wix2/wix_xsd_media.htm">
    media element</a> to the product.</p>

    <div id="xml">

      <pre>&lt;!-- 
 Source media for the installation.  
 Specifies a single cab file to be embedded in the installer&apos;s .msi.  
--&gt; 
&lt;Media Id=&quot;1&quot; Cabinet=&quot;contents.cab&quot; EmbedCab=&quot;yes&quot; CompressionLevel=&quot;high&quot;/&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    <p>Here we are specifying that the files should be embedded in the 
    installer (.msi) and we want the compression to be high. Now we 
    create a 
    <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/manual-wix2/wix_xsd_directory.htm"
    >directory</a> element, as highlighted below, so you should end up 
    with a Setup.wxs file that looks like:</p>

    <div id="xml">

      <pre>&lt;Wix xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/2003/01/wi&quot;&gt; 
 &lt;Product Id=&quot;8F3A52FE-BB54-4BC9-953C-7173D16AA96D&quot;
  Name=&quot;Code Comment Checking Policy&quot;
  Language=&quot;1033&quot;
  Version=&quot;1.0.0.0&quot;
  Manufacturer=&quot;ic#code&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;Package Id=&quot;A970C90A-3EFD-4121-B92D-2D0454643B38&quot;
   Description=&quot;Installs Code Comment Checking Policy for VSTS&quot; 
   Comments=&quot;Comments&quot; InstallerVersion=&quot;200&quot; 
   Compressed=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt; 
  &lt;!-- 
   Source media for the installation.  
    Specifies a single cab file to be embedded in the installer&apos;s .msi.  
  --&gt; 
  &lt;Media Id=&quot;1&quot; Cabinet=&quot;contents.cab&quot; EmbedCab=&quot;yes&quot; CompressionLevel=&quot;high&quot; /&gt; 
<b>  &lt;!-- Installation directory and files are defined in Files.wxs --&gt; 
  &lt;Directory Id=&quot;TARGETDIR&quot; Name=&quot;SourceDir&quot;/&gt; </b>
 &lt;/Product&gt; 
&lt;/Wix&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    <p>The 
    <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa371857.aspx">
    SourceDir</a> directory does not get created on installation. It is 
    just the name used to identify where in the WiX XML to look for the 
    files and directories that will be installed. Which is what we will 
    now look at.</p>

    <p>We are going to create a new WiX file (Files.wxs) that will 
    contain information about the files to be installed. Open the 
    <b>Project Explorer</b>, if it is not already open, by selecting 
    <b>Projects</b> from the <b>View</b> menu.</p>

    <p><img alt="View projects menu option"
     src="../Help/Images/ViewProjectsMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>In the <b>Projects Explorer</b> select the name of your project, 
    right click, select <b>Add</b> and then <b>New Item...</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="Menu option to add a new file to a project"
     src="Images/AddNewWixFileToProjectMenu.png"/></p>

    <p>This opens the <b>New File</b> dialog box.</p>

    <p><img alt="New File Dialog"
     src="Images/NewFileDialogWithEmptySetupFileSelected.png"/></p>

    <p>Select the <b>Setup</b> category, and then select <b>Empty Setup 
    Document</b> from the list of available templates. Type in the name 
    <b>Files.wxs</b> and then click the <b>Create</b> button to add the 
    new file to your project.</p>

    <p>Now in order to make SharpDevelop aware that we want to put the 
    file information in Files.wxs we need to make a reference to the 
    SourceDir directory element that we added to Setup.wxs. If we do 
    not do this then when we add files using the Setup Files Editor the 
    file information will be added to the Setup.wxs file inside the 
    SourceDir directory element. So modify Files.wxs so it looks 
    like:</p>

    <div id="xml">

      <pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; 
&lt;Wix xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/2003/01/wi&quot;&gt; 
 &lt;Fragment&gt; 
  &lt;DirectoryRef Id=&quot;TARGETDIR&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;/DirectoryRef&gt; 
 &lt;/Fragment&gt; 
&lt;/Wix&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    <p>Here we have referenced the SourceDir directory element by 
    referring to its Id <b>TARGETDIR</b>. Now save the Files.wxs file 
    and close it. We are now ready to add some files.</p>

    <h2>Adding Files</h2>

    <p>Open up the Setup Files editor, from the <b>View</b> menu select 
    <b>Setup</b> and then select <b>Files</b>.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/ViewSetupFilesMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>We first need to create the <b>Program Files</b> directory. The 
    directories, when we create them, will be displayed in the left 
    hand window. Right click in the left hand window, select <b>Add</b> 
    and then select <b>Directory</b>.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/SetupFilesAddDirectoryContextMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>On the right hand side of the <b>Setup Files</b> window, fill in 
    the details as shown below.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/SetupFilesProgramFilesFolderCreated.png"/></p>

    <p>Here we have specified the <b>Program Files</b> folder by using 
    the special <b>ProgramFilesFolder</b> id. In this case the 
    <b>Name</b> and <b>Long Name</b> of the directory do not matter and 
    are not used when installing. If you are creating a custom folder, 
    which is what we will do next, you will need to specify these 
    values.</p>

    <p>Now we need a <b>Cccp Policy</b> directory. This could be added 
    as we did previously, but we can add a new directory and the files 
    in one go to save us a lot of time. Here I made a <b>bin</b> folder 
    and copied into it the four files that will be a part of our 
    installer.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/CccpBinaryFiles.png"/></p>

    <p>From the <b>Setup Files</b> window, we can add the bin folder to 
    the installer by right clicking <b>Program Files</b> and selecting 
    <b>Add Directory...</b>.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/SetupFilesAddDirectoriesContextMenu.png"/></p>

    <p>Browse to the bin folder, select it and click the OK button.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/SetupFilesAddCccpBinariesFolder.png"/></p>

    <p>If you expand the bin folder just added you will see that the 
    files have been added each inside their own 
    <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/manual-wix2/wix_xsd_component.htm"
    >component</a>.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/SetupFilesCccpBinariesAdded.png"/>.</p>

    <p>Select the <b>bin</b> folder and change the name by modifying 
    the properties on the right hand side as shown below.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/SetupFilesCccpFolderNamed.png"/></p>

    <p>The files now need to be configured. The Cccppol is a .NET 
    assembly which does not need to be installed in the GAC. The 
    modified properties for this file are shown below.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/SetupFilesCccpFileProperties.png"/></p>

    <p>Here I have updated the 
    <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/manual-wix2/wix_xsd_file.htm">
    Assembly, AssemblyApplication, AssemblyManifest and KeyPath</a> 
    properties. These need to be set for a .NET assembly.</p>

    <p>The Assembly property indicates that the file is a .NET 
    assembly.</p>

    <p>The AssemblyManifest property is set to the id of the assembly 
    manifest file. In general the manifest file is the assembly 
    itself.</p>

    <p>Setting the KeyPath to true means that the installer will use 
    the existence of this file to indicate that the component is 
    installed. It is a Windows Installer 
    <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa367520.aspx">
    guideline</a> that this is set to true for a .NET assembly.</p>

    <p>The AssemblyApplication property is set to the id of the file so 
    it is not installed in the GAC. If the assembly needs to be 
    registered in the GAC then the AssemblyApplication property should 
    be left blank. If it is blank then the files will not be installed 
    into Program Files and will only exist in the GAC. If you need 
    these files to be installed into Program Files aswell you will need 
    to create a separate component and fill in the AssemblyApplication 
    property.</p>

    <p>The other files should be configured in a similar way, the only 
    difference that the AssemblyApplication should not be set since 
    they are to be registered in the GAC. As an example, the properties 
    for one file are shown below.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/SetupFilesCccpLibFileProperties.png"/></p>

    <h2>Adding a Registry Value</h2>

    <p>Now that the files have been added we need to add the registry 
    value. The registry value will point to the installed cccppol.dll 
    so we will put it inside the same component. Select the CccppolDll 
    component, right click, select <b>Add</b> and then select 
    <b>Registry</b>.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/SetupFilesAddRegistryContextMenu.png"/></p>

    <p>Enter the registry properties as shown below.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/SetupFilesRegistryProperties.png"/></p>

    <p>This will create a registry value <b>cccppol</b> under the 
    <b>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\TeamFoundation\SourceControl\Checkin 
    Policies</b> key. The value is set to the full path to the 
    cccppol.dll. This is done using a value of the form 
    <b>[#FileId]</b> which will expand out when installed to the full 
    path of the file. A value of the form <b>[!FileId]</b> would expand 
    to the short name of the file (i.e. it includes ~ characters).</p>

    <p>We have now finished with the <b>Setup Files</b> editor so you 
    can close it. If you want you can open up the Files.wxs file and 
    see the WiX XML that has been generated.</p>

    <h2>Adding Features</h2>

    <p>Now that we have added the files to the installer we need to 
    associate these files with 
    <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/manual-wix2/wix_xsd_feature.htm"
    >features</a> so they will be installed. Currently SharpDevelop 
    does not have a GUI editor for features so you will have to add 
    them by hand. Open Setup.wxs and inside the Product element add the 
    following:</p>

    <div id="xml">

      <pre>  &lt;!-- Features to install --&gt; 
  &lt;Feature Id=&quot;Complete&quot; Level=&quot;1&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;Feature Id=&quot;CodeCommentCheckingPolicyBinaries&quot; Level=&quot;1&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;ComponentRef Id=&quot;CccppolDll&quot;/&gt; 
    &lt;ComponentRef Id=&quot;ICSharpCode.CCCPLibDll&quot;/&gt; 
    &lt;ComponentRef Id=&quot;ICSharpCode.NRefactoryDll&quot;/&gt; 
    &lt;ComponentRef Id=&quot;ICSharpCode.SharpDevelop.DomDll&quot;/&gt; 
   &lt;/Feature&gt; 
  &lt;/Feature&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    <p>Here we have created two features, one called 
    <b>CodeCommentCheckingPolicyBinaries</b> that references all the 
    components we are going to install, and one parent feature called 
    <b>Complete</b>. We could have just used the one feature to install 
    everything. We have put the files into a separate feature so in the 
    future we could an add extra feature containing documentation that 
    could be optionally installed.</p>

    <h2>Adding Dialogs</h2>

    <p>Now we need to show some dialogs when the installer is run. WiX 
    ships with a 
    <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/manual-wix2/WixUI_dialog_library.htm"
    >dialog library</a> which saves you the time and effort of creating 
    new dialogs. The dialog library supports several different dialog 
    sequences. We want to show a license and allow the user to choose 
    the installation folder and for this we can use the 
    <b>WixUI_InstallDir</b> sequence of dialogs. In Setup.wxs insert 
    the following xml inside the Product element.</p>

    <div id="xml">

      <pre>  &lt;!-- Use Wix UI library --&gt; 
  &lt;Property Id=&quot;WIXUI_INSTALLDIR&quot;&gt;INSTALLDIR&lt;/Property&gt; 
  &lt;UIRef Id=&quot;WixUI_InstallDir&quot;/&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    <p>The <b>WIXUI_INSTALLDIR</b> property is used to tell the WiX 
    dialog library the id of the directory that the user is allowed to 
    configure. In our case it is <b>INSTALLDIR</b>.</p>

    <p>Now we need to add the WiX dialog library to our project. In the 
    <b>Project Browser</b>, select <b>WiX Libraries</b>, right click 
    and select <b>Wix Library</b>.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/AddWixLibrariesContextMenu.png"/></p>

    <p>Now browse to the file <b>wixui.wixlib</b>, which is shipped 
    with SharpDevelop in the subfolder <b>bin\Tools\Wix</b> folder. 
    Select the file and click the <b>Open</b> button. The WiX dialog 
    library should then be added to your project.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/WixUiLibraryAddedToProject.png"/></p>

    <p>Now we need to add the WiX localisation file (.wxl) to the 
    project. A localisation file contains all the strings that are 
    displayed in the dialogs. We are going to use the English 
    localisation file since this is complete. For information on the 
    status of other localisations refer to the 
    <a href="http://www.tramontana.co.hu/wix/loc/index.php">WiX 
    localisation project page</a>. From the <b>Project</b> menu select 
    <b>Project Options</b>.</p>

    <p><img src="../Help/Images/ProjectOptionsMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>In the <b>Application</b> tab, locate the <b>Localisation string 
    file</b> field, click the <b>Browse</b> button 
    <img src="../Help/Images/BrowseButton.png"/> to open the <b>Open 
    File</b> dialog, locate the <b>WixUI_en-us.wxl</b> file inside the 
    <b>bin\Tools\Wix</b> folder, select it and click the <b>Open</b> 
    button. The localisation file should then be added to the project 
    options.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/WixLocalisedFileSetInProjectOptions.png"/></p>

    <p>Save the changes you have made to the project options. We have 
    not quite finished, but you can test the dialogs if you want. First 
    build the project. From the <b>Build</b> menu, select <b>Build 
    Cccp.Setup</b>.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/BuildCccpProjectMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>Once the installer has built successfully, run it by selecting 
    <b>Run</b> from the <b>Debug</b> menu.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/DebugRunMenuOption.png"/></p>

    <p>You should then see the first setup dialog.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/CccpSetupDialog.png"/></p>

    <h2>Showing the License</h2>

    <p>If you tried out all the setup dialogs you will see that an end 
    user license is displayed. In order to get a custom license shown 
    we need to create a rich text document called <b>License.rtf</b> 
    and put it into the same folder as the WiX project file 
    (Cccp.Setup.wixproj). Then on rebuilding the project the custom 
    license will be taken from this file, embedded into the installer 
    and displayed when installing.</p>

    <h2>Installation Conditions</h2>

    <p>Now we want the installer to inform the user that the installer 
    can only be run under the following conditions:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>.NET 2.0 is installed.</li>

      <li>The OS is at least Windows 2000.</li>

      <li>User has Administrator privileges.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>To do this we add three 
    <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/manual-wix2/wix_xsd_condition.htm"
    >Condition</a> elements to Setup.wxs inside the Product element.</p>

    <div id="xml">

      <pre>  &lt;!-- 
   Check for .NET 2.0  
  --&gt; 
  &lt;Condition Message=&quot;This setup requires the .NET Framework 2.0 or higher.&quot;&gt; 
   Installed OR MsiNetAssemblySupport &amp;gt;= &quot;2.0.50727&quot; 
  &lt;/Condition&gt; 
   
  &lt;!-- 
   Check for the operating system is at least Windows 2000 (VersionNT = 500).  
  --&gt; 
  &lt;Condition Message=&quot;The operating system you are using is not supported (95/98/ME/NT3.x/NT4.x).&quot;&gt; 
   Installed OR VersionNT &amp;gt;= 500 
  &lt;/Condition&gt; 
   
  &lt;!-- Check for admin rights --&gt; 
  &lt;Condition Message=&quot;Administrator rights are required to install the Code Comment Checking Policy.&quot;&gt; 
   Privileged 
  &lt;/Condition&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    <p>If a condition fails then a message will be displayed. Some of 
    the conditions also use have an <b>Installed OR</b> part which 
    means the installer will never prevent the user from repairing or 
    uninstalling the package if it is already installed.</p>

    <p>Now all that is left to do is run the installer and check that 
    it actually installs everything correctly.</p>

    <h2>Validating the Installer</h2>

    <p>After you have tested out your installer, making sure it creates 
    the correct registry key, and copies the files to the correct 
    location, you should validate the created msi file.</p>

    <p>To validate the installer you can use one of the validation 
    tools provided by Microsoft. One such tool is 
    <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370557.aspx">
    Orca</a> which is available as part of the 
    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0baf2b35-c656-4969-ace8-e4c0c0716adb"
    >Windows 2003 R2 Platform SDK</a>. Orca was originally created by 
    <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/archive/2003/10/11/56487.aspx"
    >Rob Mensching</a> and as well as allowing you to validate your 
    installer it also allows you to view and edit the various tables 
    inside your .msi file.</p>

    <p>To validate the installer with Orca.exe, use the <b>File</b> 
    menu to open the .msi file, then from the <b>Tools</b> menu select 
    <b>Validate</b>.</p>

    <p>From the dialog that opens we can choose various validation 
    suites.</p>

    <p>Validating the installer we just created against the <b>Full MSI 
    Validation Suite</b> we see three warnings.</p>

    <table>

      <thead>

        <tr>

          <th>Error ID</th>

          <th>Description</th>

        </tr>

      </thead>

      <tr>

        <td>
        <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa369026.aspx"
        >ICE74</a></td>

        <td>The UpgradeCode property is not authored in the Property 
        table. It is strongly recommended that authors of installation 
        packages specify an UpgradeCode for their application.</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

        <td>
        <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa369037.aspx"
        >ICE82</a></td>

        <td>This action WelcomeDlg has duplicate sequence number 1298 
        in the table InstallUISequence</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

        <td>
        <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa369037.aspx"
        >ICE82</a></td>

        <td>This action MaintenanceWelcomeDlg has duplicate sequence 
        number 1298 in the table InstallUISequence</td>

      </tr>

    </table>

    <p>The two ICE82 warnings are from the WiX UI dialog library so we 
    shall ignore them. The other error is about upgrades. If you are 
    never going to support 
    <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370579.aspx">
    upgrades</a> then you can ignore it, but if you are or might do in 
    the future we can fix the warning by adding an UpgradeCode 
    attribute to the Product element.</p>

    <div id="xml">

      <pre>&lt;Wix xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/2003/01/wi&quot;&gt; 
 &lt;Product Id=&quot;8F3A52FE-BB54-4BC9-953C-7173D16AA96D&quot;  
          Name=&quot;Code Comment Checking Policy&quot;  
          Language=&quot;1033&quot;  
          Version=&quot;1.0.0.0&quot;  
          Manufacturer=&quot;ic#code&quot; 
          <b>UpgradeCode</b>=&quot;&quot;&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    <p>This value for this attribute is a GUID which can be quickly 
    generated either by using the keyboard shortcut <b>Ctrl+Shift+G</b> 
    or from the <b>Edit</b> menu, selecting <b>Insert</b> and then 
    <b>Insert New GUID</b>.</p>

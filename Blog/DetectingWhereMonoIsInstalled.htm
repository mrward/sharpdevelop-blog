	<body>
		Whilst looking at the NAnt config file (Nant.exe.config), I noticed
that NAnt does a much better job at detecting where the Mono compilers,
Mcs and Gmcs, are located. NAnt reads the registry, whilst SharpDevelop
assumes that they exist somewhere in a folder, typically "C:\Program
Files\Mono\bin", that has been added to the Path environment variable.
If you add the "C:\Program Files\Mono\bin" folder to the Path then
everything should work. In this bin folder there are several .bat files
that can be used to run the various Mono compilers, and these are what
SharpDevelop uses. The Mono executables live in "C:\Program
Files\Mono\lib\mono\1.0" and "C:\Program Files\Mono\lib\mono\2.0",
depending on the framework being targeted, and the .bat files run these
executables under Mono.

<b>Mono's Registry Settings</b>

<br>
<br>
When you install Mono under Windows the installer adds a registry key
under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Novell\Mono, and the values entered
here can be used to detect where Mono is.<br>
<br>
<font color="#000000">[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Novell\Mono]<br>
DefaultCLR=1.1.9.2<br>
<br>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Novell\Mono\1.1.9.2]<br>
FrameworkAssemblyDirectory=C:\Program Files\Mono\lib<br>
MonoConfigDir=C:\Program Files\Mono\etc<br>
SdkInstallRoot=C:\Program Files\Mono

</font><br>
<br>
SharpDevelop will now use the registry to locate the Mono bin folder,
and if this fails then it falls back on its original method of assuming
that the compiler lives in a folder added to the Path.<br>
<br>
This small improvement has been added to SharpDevelop 2.0 in revision 593.

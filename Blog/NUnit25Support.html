    <h2>NUnit 2.5 Changes</h2>

    <p>NUnit 2.5 has changed quite substantially compared with the 
    previous 2.4.8 release, as outlined in the 
    <a href="http://nunit.com/index.php?p=releaseNotes&amp;r=2.5">NUnit 
    2.5 release notes</a>. The problems that we had when migrating 
    SharpDevelop&apos;s unit tests to NUnit 2.5 were as follows.</p>

    <ol>

      <li>

        <b>Assert.IsInstanceOfType has been replaced by 
        Assert.IsInstanceOf.</b>
        <p>Your code will still compile and work if 
        Assert.IsInstanceOfType is used but you will get compiler 
        warnings.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <b>NUnit.Framework.SyntaxHelpers namespace no longer exists.</b>
        <p>All classes that were in this namespace have been moved to 
        the NUnit.Framework namespace.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <b>The Has.Count constraint no longer takes an integer 
        parameter.</b>
        <p>To fix this problem replace code such as:</p>

        <pre>Assert.That(classesCollection, Has.Count(1));</pre>
        <p>With the following:</p>

        <pre>Assert.That(classesCollection.Has.Count.EqualTo(1));</pre>
      </li>

      <li>

        <b>Overriding a [TestFixtureSetUp] method in a derived class 
        using the new keyword no longer works.</b>
        <p>Some of the SharpDevelop unit tests were overriding an 
        abstract base test class [TestFixtureSetUp] method in a derived 
        class by using the new keyword, as shown below.</p>

        <p>Base class:</p>

        <pre>[TestFixtureSetUp] 
public void SetUpFixture()  
{ 
    // Setup code. 
}</pre>
        <p>Derived class:</p>

        <pre>[TestFixtureSetUp] 
public new void SetUpFixture()  
{     
    // Extra setup code. 
    base.SetUpFixture(); 
}</pre>
        <p>In NUnit 2.4.8 the SetUpFixture method in the derived class 
        would be called when running the tests allowing it to execute 
        some extra setup steps. In NUnit 2.5 the base class 
        SetUpFixture method is called instead and the derived class 
        method is never called. To resolve the problem we changed the 
        base class so it used a virtual method and allowed the derived 
        class to override this to execute its extra setup steps.</p>

        <p>Base class:</p>

        <pre>[TestFixtureSetUp] 
public void SetUpFixture()  
{ 
    BeforeSetUpFixture(); 
    // Setup code. 
} 
 
public virtual void BeforeSetUpFixture() 
{ 
}</pre>
        <p>Derived class:</p>

        <pre>public override void BeforeSetUpFixture() 
{ 
     // Extra setup code. 
}</pre>
      </li>

    </ol>

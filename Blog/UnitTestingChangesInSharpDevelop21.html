  <body>

    <p>The Unit Tests window in SharpDevelop 2.1 (revision 2039) has 
    been changed in order to fix a few bugs and problems that it had. 
    How you unit test in SharpDevelop is still the same, as explained 
    in the 
    <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/articles/FeatureTourUnitTesting.aspx"
    >Unit Testing feature tour</a>, but there are some new features 
    shown below. Most of the changes have been behind the scenes so 
    everything should look the essentially the same.</p>

    <h2>New Features</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Unit Tests window shows classes and methods obtained from 
      SharpDevelop&apos;s parser.</li>

      <li>Unit Tests tree dynamically updates itself to show new test 
      methods and classes as the parser information is updated.</li>

      <li>All tests are run using a slightly modified 
      nunit-console.exe.</li>

      <li>You can now run all tests from all the projects with the 
      debugger or with code coverage in one step. Previously you had to 
      select an individual project in the Unit Tests window.</li>

      <li>Running a test with code coverage or with the debugger will 
      now update the Unit Tests tree.</li>

      <li>Running tests from the Unit Tests window will use the test 
      project&apos;s app.config so you can now run tests in a 
      <b>STA</b> or <b>MTA</b>.</li>

      <li>The <b>Reload</b> and <b>Unload</b> toolbar buttons have been 
      removed since they are no longer needed.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Running Tests in a STA or MTA</h2>

    <p>By default SharpDevelop runs tests in the <b>MTA</b>. This is 
    the default behaviour of <a href="http://nunit.org">NUnit</a> which 
    is what SharpDevelop uses.</p>

    <p>To run your tests in an <b>STA</b> you can create an 
    <b>app.config</b> file for your test project as shown below:</p>

    <div id="xml">

      <pre>    &lt;configuration&gt; 
           &lt;configSections&gt;
                   &lt;sectionGroup name=&quot;NUnit&quot;&gt;
                           &lt;section name=&quot;TestRunner&quot;
                                    type=&quot;System.Configuration.NameValueSectionHandler&quot; /&gt;
                   &lt;/sectionGroup&gt;
           &lt;/configSections&gt;
           &lt;NUnit&gt;
                   &lt;TestRunner&gt;
                           &lt;!-- Valid values are STA,MTA. Others ignored. --&gt;
                           &lt;add key=&quot;ApartmentState&quot; value=&quot;STA&quot; /&gt;
                   &lt;/TestRunner&gt;
           &lt;/NUnit&gt;
    &lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Unit Tests Internals</h2>

    <p>In this section we will look at what is actually happening when 
    you open a solution and then run its tests.</p>

    <h3>Dynamically Updating Unit Tests Tree</h3>

    <p>When a solution is opened in SharpDevelop any project that has a 
    reference to the <b>NUnit.Framework</b> assembly will have a 
    corresponding tree node added to the Unit Tests tree. Expanding the 
    project node shows test classes grouped according to namespace. 
    Expanding a test class node shows the individual test methods.</p>

    <p>What classes and methods are considered to be test fixtures and 
    tests are all determined based on the information from 
    SharpDevelop&apos;s parser. If a class has a <b>[TestFixture]</b> 
    attribute then it is considered a test class. If a method has a 
    <b>[Test]</b> attribute then it is considered a test method.</p>

    <p>The Unit Tests window will update itself as the parser notices 
    changes in your code. So new test classes and methods will appear 
    in the test tree as you type.</p>

    <h3>Customised NUnit-Console</h3>

    <p>Whenever you run unit tests in SharpDevelop nunit-console.exe is 
    involved. This NUnit-Console is a slightly modified version of that 
    which ships with <a href="http://nunit.org">NUnit</a> 2.2.8. It has 
    three extra command line arguments:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>

        <b>testMethodName</b>
        <p>Added by 
        <a href="http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/default.aspx/SharpDevelop.DanielGrunwald"
        >Daniel Grunwald</a> in SharpDevelop 2.0. This allows 
        NUnit-Console to run a single test and takes the fully 
        qualified test method name.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <b>results</b>
        <p>Used to specify the filename where the test results are 
        written to as they occur.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <b>namespaceFilter</b>
        <p>If this argument is used then NUnit-Console will only run 
        the tests that exist in the specified namespace. SharpDevelop 
        sets this argument when you select a namespace node in the Unit 
        Tests tree and run the tests.</p>

      </li>

    </ol>

    <p>As the tests are run SharpDevelop monitors the generated test 
    results file. As each test result is added to the file the Unit 
    Tests tree is updated with the usual red, green and yellow colours. 
    Any test failures are added to the <b>Errors</b> window.</p>

    <p>Whenever you run a test or set of tests nunit-console.exe will 
    be run, either by SharpDevelop itself, or by 
    <a href="http://ncover.org">NCover</a> when looking at code 
    coverage, or by the debugger when you need to debug your tests.</p>

    <p><b>[Update 25th November, 2006]</b></p>

    <p>In revision 2076 you can now select a namespace node in the Unit 
    Tests tree and run only those tests for that namespace. This was 
    done by adding a new namespace filter argument to 
    nunit-console.exe. The post has been updated to reflect this.</p>

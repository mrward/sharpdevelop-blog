    <p>Since the 
    <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2011/01/23/NuGetSupportInSharpDevelop.aspx">
    NuGet support in SharpDevelop</a> was previewed back in January 
    development has continued and some new features have been added. 
    One of the new features that we will take a look at now is a new 
    PowerShell console that allows 
    <a href="http://build.sharpdevelop.net/buildartefacts/#SD41">
    SharpDevelop 4.1</a> to support installing, updating and 
    uninstalling <a href="http://nuget.org">NuGet</a> packages that 
    contain PowerShell scripts.</p>

    <h2>Package Management Console</h2>

    <p>The Package Management Console is SharpDevelop&apos;s new 
    PowerShell console. It provides several cmdlets that can be used to 
    install, uninstall or update NuGet packages. NuGet packages can 
    contain PowerShell scripts that will automate SharpDevelop and 
    extend the functionality provided by NuGet.</p>

    <p>To open the Package Management Console from the <b>View</b> menu 
    select <b>Tools</b> and then select <b>Package Management 
    Console</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="Package Management Console window"
     src="Images/PackageManagementConsoleWindow.png"/></p>

    <p>The <b>Package Source</b> drop down list is used to select the 
    NuGet package repository that will be used by default when running 
    commands. The <b>Default Project</b> drop down list has a list of 
    projects in the currently open solution and is used to select the 
    project that the console will use by default. There is also a clear 
    button which clears the text in the console window.</p>

    <p>Help on the commands can be displayed by typing <b>get-help 
    NuGet</b>. To see detailed help on a specific command type 
    <b>get-help</b> followed by the name of the command. Help on the 
    commands can also be found in the official 
    <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/package-manager-console-powershell-reference">
    NuGet Package Manager Console PowerShell Reference</a>. Please note 
    that at the time of writing some of the commands are not available 
    but will be added at some point in the future. The unsupported 
    commands are specified in the Issues section at the end of this 
    blog post.</p>

    <h2>Finding NuGet Packages</h2>

    <p>To find available NuGet packages from a NuGet package source 
    first select that source in the console&apos;s drop down list and 
    use the Get-Package command. </p>

    <p>To look for the NUnit.Sample package:</p>

    <p>
    <img alt="Looking for all NUnit NuGet packages in PowerShell Console"
     src="Images/GetPackageNUnitSampleInPackageManagementConsole.png"/></p>

    <p>To display the packages installed in the project selected in the 
    drop down list run the Get-Package command without any 
    parameters.</p>

    <p>

     src="Images/GetInstalledPackagesInPackageManagementConsole.png"/></p>

    <h2>Adding NuGet Packages</h2>

    <p>To install a package first select the required NuGet package 
    source, then select the project where the package should be 
    installed and then use the Install-Package command.</p>

    <p><img alt="Installing a NuGet package with the PowerShell console"
     src="Images/InstallingNUnitSamplePackageInPackageManagementConsole.png"/></p>

    <h2>Removing NuGet Packages</h2>

    <p>To remove a NuGet package use the Uninstall-Package command.</p>

    <p>
    <img alt="Uninstalling a NuGet package with the PowerShell console"
     src="Images/UninstallingNUnitSamplePackageInPackageManagementConsole.png"/></p>

    <h2>Updating NuGet Packages</h2>

    <p>To see packages that have updates available you can run the 
    <b>Get-Package -Updates</b> command. To update a package use the 
    Update-Package command.</p>

    <p><img alt="Updating a NuGet package in the PowerShell console"
     src="Images/UpdatingJQueryPackageInPackageManagementConsole.png"/></p>

    <h2>Add Package Reference Dialog</h2>

    <p>The Add Package Reference dialog supports installing, updating 
    or uninstalling a package with PowerShell scripts. If it detects 
    that a PowerShell script needs to be run then the package install, 
    update or uninstall actions will be run in the Package Management 
    Console. If PowerShell is not installed then the package will still 
    be installed but the PowerShell scripts will not be run.</p>

    <h2>Package PowerShell Scripts</h2>

    <p>There are three PowerShell scripts that if included in a NuGet 
    package will be run.</p>

    <ul>

      <li><b>init.ps1</b> - Runs when a package is first installed in a 
      solution and then every time the solution containing this package 
      is opened.</li>

      <li><b>install.ps1</b> - Runs every time a package is 
      installed.</li>

      <li><b>uninstall.ps1</b> - Runs every time a package is 
      uninstalled.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>More details on these scripts can be found in the NuGet 
    documentation on 
    <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package">
    Creating and Publishing a Package</a>.</p>

    <p>When these PowerShell scripts are run they are passed the 
    package, information about the package such where it will be 
    installed and a project object. The scripts also have access to a 
    global $dte variable which is made available by the PowerShell 
    console. If you are using NuGet within Visual Studio then both the 
    project object passed to a PowerShell script and the 
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s7yz5x3c.aspx">DTE 
    object</a>, made available via the $dte variable, are part of the 
    Visual Studio object model and can be used to automate Visual 
    Studio. When using SharpDevelop&apos;s PowerShell console these 
    objects are also available and can be used to automate 
    SharpDevelop. To do this SharpDevelop provides its own partial 
    implementation of the Visual Studio object model. SharpDevelop 
    implements a set of classes that provide methods and properties 
    that to PowerShell scripts look like Visual Studio&apos;s object 
    model but are not dependent on Visual Studio being installed.</p>

    <p>Since SharpDevelop&apos;s implementation of Visual Studio&apos;s 
    object model is not a full implementation there are going to be 
    some gaps which will mean a PowerShell script may produce some 
    errors when it is run. If a script tries to use a feature provided 
    only by Visual Studio then that will fail too. Another problem is 
    that if a NuGet package directly references and uses the Visual 
    Studio object model then the package will also not work. So this 
    means whilst a package such as <a href="http://haacked.com/">Phil 
    Haack&apos;s</a> 
    <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX11/FRM09#time=55m25s">
    MoodSwings</a>, which changes the text editor fonts and colours, 
    does work a package such as 
    <a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2011/01/13/scaffold-your-aspnet-mvc-3-project-with-the-mvcscaffolding-package/">
    Steve Sanderson&apos;s MvcScaffolding</a> that directly accesses 
    Visual Studio directly does not work.</p>

    <h2>Issues</h2>

    <p>The Package Management Console does not currently support tab 
    completion.</p>

    <p>The entire Visual Studio object model (DTE) is not implemented 
    so PowerShell scripts that use unimplemented features will fail.</p>

    <p>Multline PowerShell commands are not currently supported in the 
    console window.</p>

    <p>Information messages, such as successfully installing a package, 
    are not displayed in the console window and only errors are 
    displayed. These messages are only available in the Output 
    window.</p>

    <p>The NuGet PowerShell profile is not currently supported.</p>

    <p>The New-Package, Open-PackagePage, Add-BindingRedirect cmdlets 
    are not currently implemented.</p>

    <p>This tutorial shows you how to debug an ASP.NET application with 
    SharpDevelop.</p>

    <p>Before we begin it should be noted that SharpDevelop does not 
    have great ASP.NET support. There is no web forms designer, no 
    intellisense for ASP.NET pages (.aspx) and no support for the new 
    style ASP.NET Web Site projects introduced in Visual Studio 2005. 
    You can however create an ASP.NET Web Application project or an 
    ASP.NET Web Service in SharpDevelop. If you are looking for a 
    better ASP.NET experience then you should use 
    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/Web/">Microsoft Visual 
    Web Developer</a>. However if still want to use SharpDevelop then 
    here is how to debug your ASP.NET application.</p>

    <h2>Creating an ASP.NET Application</h2>

    <p>First let us create an ASP.NET Web Application. From the 
    <b>File</b> menu select <b>New</b>, then <b>Solution</b>, to open 
    up the <b>New Project</b> dialog.</p>

    <p><img alt="ASP.NET project in New Project dialog"
     src="Images/NewAspNetWebPageProjectTemplate.png"/></p>

    <p>On the left hand side of this dialog select <b>ASP.NET</b> 
    category underneath the <b>C#</b> category. On the right hand side 
    select the <b>ASP.NET web page project</b> icon. Give project a 
    name and choose where you want the project created and click the 
    <b>Create</b> button. SharpDevelop will then create a basic ASP.NET 
    Web Application project.</p>

    <h2>Download Cassini</h2>

    <p>In order to be able to debug the ASP.NET application we will be 
    using Cassini. Cassini is a lightweight open source web server. It 
    was originally released as a 
    <a href="http://www.asp.net/Downloads/archived/cassini/">sample by 
    Microsoft</a>. Dmitry Robsman then 
    <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dmitryr/archive/2008/10/03/cassini-for-framework-3-5.aspx"
    >updated the sample to run under .NET 3.5</a>. After that different 
    versions based on Dmitry&apos;s original work were released on 
    codeplex. Any of these versions of Cassini, in the list below, will 
    work with SharpDevelop. The version of Cassini provided by Dmitry 
    requires you to compile the source code. The other versions do not. 
    The Cassini Developer&apos;s edition has slightly different command 
    line options compared to the rest so it will not be covered in the 
    following discussion. We will use Cassini++ for the rest of this 
    tutorial. </p>

      <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dmitryr/archive/2008/10/03/cassini-for-framework-3-5.aspx"
      >Cassini v3.5</a> or 
      <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dmitryr/archive/2009/04/23/cassini-support-for-friendly-urls-routing.aspx"
      >Cassini v3.5.0.2</a> with friendly url/routing support.</li>

      Developers Edition</a></li>

    </ol>

    <p>Download Cassini++ from the link provided and extract the files 
    to a directory on the same machine that you are running 
    SharpDevelop on.</p>

    <h2>Debugging an ASP.NET Application</h2>

    <p>First let us set a breakpoint in our application. Find the 
    <b>Default.aspx.cs</b> file in your project and open it in the text 
    editor. Locate the Page_Load method and set a breakpoint inside 
    this method on the Response.Write line.</p>

    <p><img alt="Breakpoint set in SharpDevelop"
     src="Images/AspNetPageLoadBreakpoint.png"/></p>

    <p>Now you need to configure the project to run Cassini when you 
    debug your application. From the <b>Project</b> menu select 
    <b>Project Options</b>. In the options dialog select the 
    <b>Debug</b> tab. Set the <b>Start Action</b> to <b>Start external 
    program</b> and enter the path to the Cassini executable. In the 
    <b>Start Options</b> enter the command line that will be passed to 
    Cassini. The Cassini command line is of the form:</p>

    <pre>&lt;physical-path&gt; &lt;port&gt; &lt;virtual-path&gt;</pre>
    <p>In the screenshot below you can see an example command line 
    passed to Cassini. In this case Cassini will listen for requests on 
    port 8080, the virtual path will be set to &quot;/&quot; and the 
    physical path to your project is specified by a using SharpDevelop 
    property <b>${ProjectDir}</b> which will be replaced when you start 
    debugging. You can put the full path to your project directory here 
    instead of using the ProjectDir property.</p>

    <p><img alt="Project options dialog"
     src="Images/AspNetProjectOptionsToRunCassini.png"/></p>

    <p>Save the changes you made to the project options. Then select 
    <b>Run</b> from the <b>Debug</b> menu. Cassini should then start. 
    </p>

    <p><img alt="Cassini Running"
     src="Images/CassiniPlusPlusWindow.png"/></p>

    <p>Click the <a href="http://localhost:8080/">
    http://localhost:8080/</a> hyperlink at the bottom of the Cassini 
    window to visit your application&apos;s web page in the default 
    browser. When the page is loaded in the browser the breakpoint in 
    Page_Load should then be hit and you can start debugging.</p>

    <p><img alt="Page_Load breakpoint hit"
     src="Images/StoppedAtAspNetPageLoadBreakpoint.png"/></p>

    <h2>Attach to Process</h2>

    <p>As an alternative to configuring SharpDevelop to start Cassini 
    every time you debug your ASP.NET application you can leave Cassini 
    running and attach to its process when you need to. </p>

    <p>First on your desktop create a shortcut to Cassini and specify 
    the appropriate Cassini command line as explained earlier. Note 
    that the ${ProjectDir} property cannot be used here so instead you 
    will need to put the full path to your project. Start Cassini by 
    double clicking the shortcut and use a browser to display your web 
    page. Now in SharpDevelop select <b>Attach to Process</b> from the 
    <b>Debug</b> menu. Select the Cassini process and click the 
    <b>Attach</b> button. </p>

    <p><img alt="Attaching to the Cassini process"
     src="Images/AttachToCassiniProcess.png"/></p>

    <p>Now when you press <b>Ctrl+F5</b> in the browser showing your 
    web page to refresh the page the breakpoint in the Page_Load method 
    should be hit and you can start debugging.</p>

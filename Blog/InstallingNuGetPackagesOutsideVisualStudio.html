    <p>There have been 
    <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/discussions/246942">
    discussions</a> about using 
    <a href="http://blog.davidebbo.com/2011/05/thoughts-on-installing-and-updating.html"
    >NuGet outside of Visual Studio</a> as well as an 
    <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/818">open work item</a> 
    in the NuGet issue tracker. Outside of Visual Studio in this 
    context means using NuGet from the command line. There is support 
    for this already with NuGet.exe so let us take a quick look at what 
    is supported at the moment.</p>

    <p>Currently you can use NuGet.exe to download packages without 
    having to use Visual Studio. You can download a single package:</p>

    <pre>nuget install nunit</pre>
    <p>You can point NuGet.exe to your packages.config and it will 
    download any missing packages:</p>

    <pre>nuget install packages.config</pre>
    <p>What NuGet.exe will not do is update your project file (.csproj) 
    nor will it run any PowerShell scripts that the package uses. Which 
    is OK in the majority of cases.</p>

    <p>You can go further than this though. Since SharpDevelop supports 
    updating project files as a proof of concept we have used 
    SharpDevelop to extend NuGet further so now NuGet can support 
    everything it does from within Visual Studio but from the command 
    line. From the command line we are able to install a package, have 
    the project file updated with assembly references and any new 
    files, and finally have any PowerShell scripts included in the 
    NuGet package processed.</p>

    <p>Since NuGet uses PowerShell the simplest approach was to extend 
    the existing PowerShell cmdlets included with SharpDevelop. Now you 
    can write a few lines of PowerShell script to install a NuGet 
    package into a project that has never had a NuGet package before, 
    have the project itself updated and any package PowerShell scripts 
    run. All this from the command line without Visual Studio open.</p>

    <h2>Setting Everything Up</h2>

    <p>Download the 
    <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/NuGet/NuGetOutsideVisualStudio.zip"
    >zip file</a> containing the cmdlets and extract the assemblies.</p>

    <p>First you will need to modify the PowerShell configuration. By 
    default PowerShell will run under .NET 2.0 but we need it to run 
    under .NET 4.0 since the cmdlets use .NET 4.0. Create a 
    powershell.exe.config file in the 
    C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0 folder with the 
    following contents:</p>

    <pre>&lt;configuration&gt;  
    &lt;startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy=&quot;true&quot;&gt;  
        &lt;supportedRuntime version=&quot;v4.0.30319&quot;/&gt;  
        &lt;supportedRuntime version=&quot;v2.0.50727&quot;/&gt;  
    &lt;/startup&gt;  
&lt;/configuration&gt;   </pre>
    <p>Note that if you are running Windows x64 then you should run the 32 bit version of PowerShell 
    and create a powershell.exe.config file the
    in C:\windows\syswow64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0 folder</p>
    <p>The useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy attribute is required. 
    For a great explanation of what this attribute is take a look at 
    <a href="http://www.marklio.com/marklio/PermaLink,guid,ecc34c3c-be44-4422-86b7-900900e451f9.aspx"
    >What is useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy for?</a> written by 
    Mark Miller.</p>

    <p>To be able to run PowerShell scripts included with a NuGet 
    package the 
    <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd347641.aspx">
    execution policy</a> will need to be changed:</p>

    <pre>Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process</pre>
    <p>Now import the Package Management Cmdlets assembly. The command 
    below assumes the assembly is in the current working directory 
    otherwise the full path to the assembly will be needed.</p>

    <pre>import-module PackageManagement.Cmdlets.dll</pre>
    <p>Now we are ready to use the cmdlets.</p>

    <h2>Installing a Package</h2>

    <p>First the install-package cmdlet has a new -solution parameter 
    to support specifying the solution.</p>

    <pre>install-package nunit -solution MySolution\MySolution.sln</pre>
    <p>If you do not specify the project name then the first project in 
    the solution will be used as the default project.</p>

    <pre>install-package nunit -solution MySolution.sln -projectname MyProject</pre>
    <h2>Uninstalling a Package</h2>

    <p>To uninstall a package we can use the new -solution 
    parameter.</p>

    <pre>uninstall-package nunit -solution MySolution.sln -projectname MyProject</pre>
    <h2>Updating a Package</h2>

    <p>Once again we can specify the solution filename when updating a 
    package.</p>

    <pre>update-package nunit -solution MySolution.sln -projectname MyProject</pre>
    <p>Ideally we would like to be able to update all projects in the 
    solution in one go however this is not currently implemented.</p>

    <h2>Setting a Default Project</h2>

    <p>Instead of specifying the solution when running each command you 
    can set a default project with the new Set-Project command.</p>

    <pre>set-project MyProject d:\Projects\MyProject\MySolution.sln</pre>
    <p>After setting the default project the other commands can be run 
    without the need to specify the -solution parameter or the name of 
    the project.</p>

    <h2>Package PowerShell Scripts</h2>

    <p>Since SharpDevelop has its own set of DTE objects any PowerShell 
    scripts in the package can be run. Each of the cmdlets described 
    above define the DTE variable before any Powershell scripts 
    included with the package are run.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>So finally we can now use a single PowerShell script to install 
    packages into an empty project. As a simple example:</p>

    <p>setup.ps1:</p>

    <pre>import-module d:\scripts\PackageManagement.Cmdlets.dll 
 
$solution = &quot;d:\Projects\MyProject\MyProject.sln&quot; 
set-project MyProject $solution

install-package nunit</pre>
    <p>To run this from the command line with PowerShell:</p>

    <pre>powershell -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -File d:\projects\MyProject\setup.ps1</pre>
    <h2>Issues</h2>

    <p>If you are using $host.Version then within the PowerShell this 
    will return the PowerShell host version and not the NuGet 
    PowerShell host version.</p>

    <p>Several extra SharpDevelop assemblies are included in the zip 
    file. This could be reduced with some more work.</p>

    <p>The formatting for NuGet packages is not defined so the output 
    is a list of properties for each package object.</p>

    <h2>Source Code</h2>

    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/mrward/SharpDevelop/tree/nuget">
    source code</a> is available on github. It is not a part of 
    SharpDevelop since this was an prototype. So there are no unit 
    tests for the new code and core parts of SharpDevelop have been 
    changed to support the new PowerShell cmdlets.</p>

    PowerShell if using Windows x64</p>

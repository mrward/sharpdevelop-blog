<body>
In revision 983 SharpDevelop2 has support for Mono's GAC.&nbsp; It also
includes new Gtk# and Glade# project templates, and a Gtk# Window file
template.&nbsp; Mono can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads">here</a> <br><br><b>Creating a new Glade# Project</b><br><ol><li>Select the menu option File | New | Solution to open the "New Project" dialog. </li><li>Select the C# category.</li><li>There are two new projects here, a Gtk# project and a Glade# project.&nbsp; Select the Glade# project.<br><br><img src="SharpDevelop2AndMonosGac_files/original_003.png"><br><br></li><li>Enter a name for the project and select the "Create" button to generate the project.<br><br><img src="SharpDevelop2AndMonosGac_files/original_004.png"><br><br></li></ol>The generated project will target Mono 1.1 by default, and will use Mono's Mcs compiler.<br><br><b>Running the Glade# Application</b><br><br>If
you have the Mono bin directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\Mono\bin) added
to your Path environment variable, the project can be started by
selecting the menu option Debug | Run or Debug | Run without debugger.
This will run the application under the Microsoft .NET framework and
not Mono itself, to run under Mono see this <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2005/10/12/SharpDevelopAndMono.aspx">post</a>. <br><br>Note that you cannot debug the application when it is built with either of the Mono compilers.<br><br><b>Adding a Mono GAC Reference</b><br><ol><li>Open the Project Browser via View | Project.</li><li>Select the "References" node, right click and select "Add Mono Reference".&nbsp; <br><br><img src="SharpDevelop2AndMonosGac_files/original_002.png"><br><br></li><li>Select the GAC entry that will be added to the project, click the
Select button and then click the OK button to add the reference to the
project. <br></li></ol><img src="SharpDevelop2AndMonosGac_files/original.png"><br><b><br>Code Completion</b><br><br>There
is a small problem with code auto-completion.&nbsp; In order for
auto-completion to work the reference must be added via the "Add Mono
Reference" dialog.&nbsp; So the first time a Glade# or Gtk# project has
been created you will have to remove the GAC references and then re-add
them to get code auto-completion working.&nbsp; This only needs to be
done once, not every time a Gtk# or Glade# project is created. <br><br><b>Debugging a Mono Application</b><br><br>You
cannot debug a Mono app built using Mcs or Gmcs.&nbsp; The Mono
compilers create their own open source debugging symbols binary (.mdb)
which SharpDevelop and Microsoft's DbgCLR do not support.&nbsp; There
is also no Mono debugger available for Windows.&nbsp; In order to debug
a Mono app it needs to be built using the Microsoft Csc compiler.&nbsp;
The general guidelines to be able to debug your Mono app using the
SharpDevelop debugger are:<br><ol><li>Make sure all Mono specific GAC references have "Local Copy" set to
true.&nbsp; Select the reference in the Project Browser and select
Properties to set this.</li><li>The Mono bin directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\Mono\bin) must be added to the Path environment variable.</li><li>Change the "Target Framework" (Project | Project Options | Compiling) to one of the Microsoft .NET frameworks.</li><li>Remove and re-add your Mono GAC references using the "Add Mono
Reference" dialog.&nbsp; You should only need to do this once and only if
you are using a project created from the Glade# or Gtk# templates.&nbsp;
Doing this will add a HintPath to the references in your MSBuild
project so the Microsoft compilers can locate the assemblies in the
Mono GAC.&nbsp; These HintPaths are not currently added to a newly created
Glade/Gtk# project.</li><li>Rebuild your application.</li></ol>Once
the HintPaths have been added to your MSBuild project you should be
able to switch between the Microsoft and Mono frameworks as required,
and build your code using the Microsoft or Mono compilers.<br><br>If
you are going to debug a Gtk# or Glade# application you will need to
add extra GAC references.&nbsp; Mcs and Gmcs do not need all Gtk#
references to be added, but Microsoft's Csc compiler does.&nbsp; For a
Gtk# app you will need at least:<br><ul><li>atk-sharp</li><li>gdk-sharp</li><li>glib-sharp</li><li>gtk-sharp</li><li>pango-sharp</li></ul>Also add glade-sharp if you are developing a Glade# app.<br><br><b>Links</b><br><br><a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads">Mono Downloads</a><br><a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2005/10/12/SharpDevelopAndMono.aspx">Targeting Mono with SharpDevelop2</a><br><a href="http://build.sharpdevelop.net/BuildArtefacts/">SharpDevelop Daily Builds</a><br>

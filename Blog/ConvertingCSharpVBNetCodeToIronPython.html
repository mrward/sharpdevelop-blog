    <p>SharpDevelop 3.1 now supports converting C# and VB.NET code to 
    IronPython. It can convert a single file or an entire project. The 
    code to convert between these languages is still under development 
    and has some limitations. </p>

    <h2>Converting an Individual File</h2>

    <p>To convert a C# or VB.NET file, open it in SharpDevelop&apos;s 
    text editor, then from <b>Tools</b> menu select <b>Convert code to 
    Python</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="Convert code to Python menu option."
     src="Images/ConvertCodeToPythonMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>The code conversion is limited to converting classes so it will 
    not convert an arbitary piece of code that is not inside a 
    class.</p>

    <h2>Converting a Project</h2>

    <p>To convert a C# or VB.NET project, open it in SharpDevelop, then 
    from the <b>Project</b> menu select <b>Convert From C# to 
    Python</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="Convert from C# project to Python project menu option."
     src="Images/ProjectConvertFromCSharpToPythonMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>Once converted the project will most likely not compile straight 
    away due to limitations in the implementation. At the time of 
    writing converting a project has the following limitations:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Project&apos;s Main File is not set.</li>

      <li>No code generated to call the project&apos;s Main entry 
      method.</li>

      <li>Namespace imports do include all the used classes.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Code Conversion Internals</h2>

    <p>Converting code to IronPython was originally supported in 
    <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2007/10/21/IronPythonIntegrationInSharpDevelop22.aspx">
    SharpDevelop 2.2</a> and was based on converting code to a 
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y2k85ax6.aspx">
    Microsoft CodeDOM</a> and then getting IronPython 1.0 to generate 
    the Python code. In IronPython 2.0 this CodeDOM support was removed 
    so the code conversion feature was removed from SharpDevelop 3.0 
    since that was using IronPython 2.0. In SharpDevelop 3.1 the code 
    conversion has been rewritten to no longer use the CodeDOM support. 
    It now works by executing the following simple steps:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>The C# or VB.NET code is parsed using SharpDevelop&apos;s 
      parsing library 
      <a href="http://laputa.sharpdevelop.net/NRefactoryTutorialVideo.aspx">
      NRefactory</a> and an 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">
      abstract syntax tree (AST)</a> is generated.</li>

      <li>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">
      visitor</a> class then walks this AST and generates Python code 
      which is added to a StringBuilder.</li>

      <li>Once the visit is complete the generated Python code is then 
      displayed or saved to disk.</li>

    </ol>

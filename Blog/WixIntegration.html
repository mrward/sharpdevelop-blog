    <p>Support for creating <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net">
    WiX</a> setup packages is now available in SharpDevelop 2.1. It was 
    originally disabled in SharpDevelop 2.0, but has now been 
    re-enabled and some new features have been added. It is still a 
    work in progress. Some parts are not quite finished and there are 
    some missing features, but it is currently being used to build and 
    maintain the installer for SharpDevelop itself. At the moment 
    SharpDevelop ships with WiX 2.0.4221, but it will be updated to 
    2.0.4415.0 shortly.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>WiX project and file templates.</li>

      <li>Build a setup package (.msi), merge module (.msm) or WiX 
      Library (.wixlib) from inside SharpDevelop. All built using 
      MSBuild and WiX&apos;s custom MSBuild tasks.</li>

      <li>Add WiX libraries, WiX extensions and preprocessor variables 
      to the WiX project.</li>

      <li>WiX Dialog Designer.</li>

      <li>Setup Dialogs window. Lists all dialogs in a project. Each 
      dialog can then be opened up in the designer.</li>

      <li>Setup Files editor. Add directories, components and files to 
      the installer via a GUI instead of editing the XML.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>The next sections will look at the WiX support in more 
    detail.</p>

    <h2>Creating a WiX Project</h2>

    <p>To create a new WiX project, from the <b>File</b> menu, select 
    <b>New</b> and then select <b>Solution...</b>. In the <b>New 
    Project</b> dialog select the <b>Setup</b> category.</p>

    <p><img alt="WiX project templates in the New Project dialog"
     src="Images/WixProjectTemplatesNonEmptyProjectSelected.png"/></p>

    <p>SharpDevelop has two WiX project templates available</p>

    <ul>

      <li>

        Empty Setup.
        <p>This project template creates a Solution (.sln), a WiX 
        Project (.wixproj) and a minimal WiX Setup file (.wxs).</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        Setup.
        <p>The Setup project template creates a basic WiX project which 
        can be built immediately after creation.</p>

        <p><img alt="Setup project open in Project Browser"
         src="Images/WixProjectOpenInProjectBrowser.png"/></p>

        <p>The installer created by this project installs a License.rtf 
        file to the installation directory.</p>

        <p>The Setup project template also has its own dialogs which 
        can be customised.</p>

      </li>

    </ul>

    <p>The Setup project is the project we will be using in this 
    walkthrough.</p>

    <h2>Building</h2>

    <p>Building the WiX project is done in the same way as for other 
    projects in SharpDevelop from the build menu.</p>

    <p><img alt="Build menu for MySetup project"
     src="Images/BuildMenuForMySetupProject.png"/></p>

    <p>Output messages from the WiX compiler and linker are displayed 
    in the Output window and any errors are added to the Errors 
    window.</p>

    <h2>Creating a Merge Module or WiX Library</h2>

    <p>By default the project will build an MSI file. You can choose to 
    create a merge module (.msm) or WiX Library (.wixlib) from the 
    project options. Select the project in the <b>Project Browser</b>, 
    then from the <b>Project</b> menu select <b>Project Options</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="WiX Project options"
     src="Images/WixProjectApplicationOptions.png"/></p>

    <p>From the <b>Application</b> tab you can change the output type 
    to msi, msm or wixlib.</p>

    <p><img alt="WiX Project output types"
     src="Images/WixProjectOutputTypes.png"/></p>

    <h2>Running</h2>

    <p>To run the installer, select <b>Run</b> from the <b>Debug</b> 
    menu or press <b>F5</b>. The installer will then be built and run 
    and you will see the first dialog of your installer.</p>

    <p><img alt="Running the installer from inside SharpDevelop"
     src="Images/RunningWixInstallerFirstDialogShown.png"/></p>

    <h2>Adding a new WiX File</h2>

    <p>You can either have one big WiX setup file (.wxs) or split the 
    project up into several different files. The WiX MSBuild tasks will 
    compile all the WiX files and link them all into one installer.</p>

    <p>To add a new WiX file, select the project in the <b>Project 
    Browser</b> window, right click, select <b>Add</b> and then select 
    <b>New Item...</b>. From the <b>New File dialog</b> selecting the 
    <b>Setup</b> category will show you the WiX file templates.</p>

    <p><img alt="WiX file templates in File dialog"
     src="Images/WixFileTemplatesInNewFileDialog.png"/></p>

    <h2>Adding WiX Libraries</h2>

    <p>To add a wixlib to your project, select <b>WiX Libraries</b> in 
    the <b>Project Browser</b>, right click and select <b>Add WiX 
    Library</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="Add WiX Library menu item"
     src="Images/WixProjectBrowserAddWixLibraryContextMenu.png"/></p>

    <p>This opens up the file dialog where you can browse to one or 
    more wixlibs and add them to the project.</p>

    <h2>Adding WiX Extensions</h2>

    <p>WiX extensions can be added to the project in the 
    <b>Compiling</b>, <b>Library</b> and <b>Linking</b> tabs available 
    from the project options. The <b>Compiling</b> tab determines what 
    extensions are passed to Candle the WiX compiler. The 
    <b>Linking</b> tab determines what extensions get passed to Light 
    the WiX linker. The <b>Library</b> tab determines what extensions 
    get passed to Lit the Wix Library Tool. If you are creating a setup 
    package (.msi) then typically you should put the extensions in the 
    <b>Compiling</b> and <b>Linking</b> tab. If you are creating a WiX 
    Library (.wixlib) then you need to put the extensions in the 
    <b>Library</b> tab.</p>

    <p><img alt="WiX Linking tab showing extensions"
     src="Images/WixLinkingTabShowingExtensions.png"/></p>

    <p>The extensions can either be typed in directly into the 
    Extensions text box, one per line, as shown above, or you can click 
    the <b>Add</b> button to open the <b>Add Extensions</b> dialog and 
    select one or more of the standard extensions WiX provides.</p>

    <p><img alt="Add WiX Extensions dialog"
     src="Images/AddWixExtensionsDialog.png"/></p>

    <h2>Preprocessor Variables</h2>

    <p><a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/manual-wix2/preprocessor.htm"
    >Preprocessor variables</a> can be added in the 
    <b>Preprocessing</b> tab available from the project options.</p>

    <p><img alt="WiX Preprocessor Variables defined in project options"
     src="Images/WixPreprocessingVariablesDefined.png"/></p>

    <p>In the screenshot above the DATADIR variable is defined. 
    Generally the variable values will just be strings, but you can 
    also use MSBuild properties. In the screenshot above the 
    SharpDevelopBinPath MSBuild property is being used. You can use 
    MSBuild properties here since these properties will be expanded 
    before WiX compiles anything.</p>

    <p>In the UserInterface.wxs file the DATADIR preprocessor variable 
    is referenced as shown below:</p>

    <p><code>&lt;Binary Id=&quot;dialog.bmp&quot; 
    SourceFile=&quot;$(var.DATADIR)/default-dialog.bmp&quot; 
    /&gt;</code></p>

    <h2>Visually Designing a Dialog</h2>

    <p>To open a setup dialog in the designer, open the WiX file, move 
    the cursor so it is inside the dialog element, then click the 
    <b>Design</b> tab.</p>

    <p><img alt="WiX dialog in designer"
     src="Images/WixDialogDesigner.png"/></p>

    <p>You can also open a dialog in the designer from the <b>Setup 
    Dialogs Window</b>, which is described in the next section.</p>

    <p>You can have multiple dialogs defined in one WiX file or create 
    one file per dialog, it is up to you. If you have multiple dialogs 
    then you need to move the cursor inside the dialog element before 
    you select the Design tab otherwise the designer will not know 
    which dialog to load. If you have only one dialog element in the 
    file then the cursor can be anywhere in the WiX document and does 
    not need to be inside the dialog element.</p>

    <p>In the designer you can reposition, resize and remove existing 
    controls. You can also add new WiX controls from the Setup Dialog 
    Controls tab by dragging them to the dialog.</p>

    <p><img alt="Setup dialog controls in the toolbox"
     src="Images/SetupDialogControlsToolbox.png"/></p>

    <p>At the moment not all the WiX controls are supported and WiX 
    specific properties are not available in the properties window.</p>

    <h2>Setup Dialogs Window</h2>

    <p>To open the <b>Setup Dialogs</b> window, from the <b>View</b> 
    menu select <b>Setup</b> and then select <b>Dialogs</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="View setup dialogs menu item"
     src="Images/ViewSetupDialogsMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>The <b>Setup Dialogs</b> window is then opened.</p>

    <p><img alt="Setup dialogs window"
     src="Images/SetupDialogsWindow.png"/></p>

    <p>This window lists all the dialogs available in the project. You 
    can open a dialog into the designer by right clicking it and 
    selecting <b>Open</b>. Or view its XML by selecting <b>View 
    Code</b>.</p>

    <h2>Visually Editing Directories, Components and Files</h2>

    <p>To open the <b>Setup Files Editor</b>, from the <b>View</b> menu 
    select <b>Setup</b> and then select <b>Files</b>.</p>

    <p>The Setup Files Editor will look at all the WiX files in the 
    project for the <b>TARGETDIR</b> Directory element or the 
    DirectoryRef element. Once this is found then it will show the 
    directories, components and files that will be installed.</p>

    <p><img alt="Files editor" src="Images/SetupFilesEditor.png"/></p>

    <p>The left hand side of the editor shows the files in a tree view. 
    On the right hand side of the editor you can modify the properties 
    of the currently selected item.</p>

    <p>You can add directories, files and components to your installer 
    by right clicking a tree node, selecting <b>Add</b> and then 
    choosing an item to add.</p>

    <p><img alt="Setup Files editor add menu"
     src="Images/SetupFilesEditorAddMenu.png"/></p>

    <h2>Adding Directories</h2>

    <p>To add a directory and all its contents recursively to your 
    setup, select the tree node where you want your directory added to, 
    then right click and select <b>Add Directory</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="Add directories menu item"
     src="Images/SetupFilesEditorAddDirectoryMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>This opens the <b>Browser for Folder</b> dialog. Select the 
    directory and then click <b>OK</b> to have that directory and all 
    its contents added to the setup package. Every file added will have 
    its own component.</p>

    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>

    <p>The WiX integration is not completely finished. Here is a list 
    of items that will hopefully be added at some point.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Improve the WiX dialog designer. Add support for all the WiX 
      controls.</li>

      <li>

        <p>Improve the files editor.</p>

        <ul>

          <li>Drag and drop support.</li>

          <li>Directory vs installer diff. Shows missing and new 
          files.</li>

        </ul>

      </li>

      <li>Add support for WiX include files (.wxi).</li>

      <li>

        <p>Add GUI Editors for:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>Features</li>

          <li>Properties</li>

          <li>Binaries</li>

          <li>Icons</li>

          <li>Sequences</li>

          <li>Error and UI Text.</li>

        </ul>

      </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Alternatives</h2>

    <p>There are a few other applications and plug-ins available that 
    can be used to create WiX installers instead of SharpDevelop. Here 
    is a list of the ones I am aware of.</p>

    <h2>Votive</h2>

    <p><a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/downloadv3.html">Votive</a> 
    is a Visual Studio plug-in that you can use to create WiX setup 
    packages from inside Visual Studio.</p>

    <p>Just a few days ago, September 15th, 
    <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jrock/default.aspx">Justin 
    Rockwood</a> released 
    <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jrock/archive/2006/09/15/757144.aspx"
    >Votive version 3</a>, which supports Visual Studio 2005. It does 
    not have a dialog designer, but that is on its list of features 
    that will be added in the future.</p>

    <h2>WiX Edit</h2>

    <p><a href="http://wixedit.sourceforge.net">WiX Edit</a> is a 
    standalone WiX Editor application, created by Jasper Keuper, that 
    you can use to create WiX setup packages. It includes a dialog 
    designer along with a whole host of other features, that 
    SharpDevelop does not have. In fact you can create an installer and 
    never look at any XML.</p>

    <h2>WixTrim</h2>

    <p><a href="http://zelenkov.com/twix/download/">WixTrim</a> is a 
    WiX Visual Editor, created by Oleg Zelenkov, that supports a very 
    advanced dialog designer amongst other features. The source code 
    for the editor is also available from 
    <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=424F1B93-78BF-47EE-9EAB-B0F72A18A231"
    >GotDotNet</a>. Unfortunately, WixTrim is not under active 
    development like the previous two.</p>

    <h2>WiX Tutorial</h2>

    <p>If you want to learn more about WiX then a fantastic WiX 
    tutorial, created by Gabor Deak Jahn, is available 
    <a href="http://www.tramontana.co.hu/wix/">online</a>.</p>

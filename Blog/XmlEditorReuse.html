    <title>XML Editor Reuse</title>

    <p>It is always good to see that someone else finds the code that 
    you have written useful enough to be reused in another application. 
    Here we take a look at where SharpDevelop&apos;s XML Editor has 
    been reused. The XML Editor was originally added to SharpDevelop 
    1.0 back in April 2005.</p>

    <h2>MonoDevelop</h2>

    <p>Some time ago I ported SharpDevelop&apos;s XML Editor so it 
    could be used from inside <a href="http://www.monodevelop.com">
    MonoDevelop</a>. Currently there is an 
    <a href="http://md-xed.sourceforge.net/">addin available for 
    MonoDevelop 1.0</a>. MonoDevelop 2.0 now ships with this XML Editor 
    after <a href="http://mjhutchinson.com/">Michael Hutchinson</a> 
    from Novell integrated it in March this year. I also believe that 
    it is being used to help provide at least some part of the 
    autocompletion for ASP.NET. It will be interesting to see how 
    Michael builds on and improves the XML Editor code.</p>

    <h2>Kaxaml</h2>

    <p><a href="http://www.kaxaml.com">Kaxaml</a> is a lightweight XAML 
    Editor written by <a href="http://www.notstatic.com">Robby 
    Ingebretsen</a>. Kaxaml version 1.0 and 2.0 use a modified version 
    of SharpDevelop&apos;s XML Editor. Robby has replaced the user 
    interface part so the autocompletion popup window now uses WPF. He 
    has also modified it so the autocompletion popup window behaves the 
    same as Visual Studio&apos;s XML Editor. For example, SharpDevelop 
    automatically inserts the equals sign and double quotes an 
    attribute name is autocompleted whilst Visual Studio will 
    autocomplete just the attribute name and then automatically insert 
    the double quotes after the equals sign is typed in.</p>

    <h2>Intellisense for Microsoft Expression Blend 2.5</h2>

    <p>
    <a href="http://blogs.telerik.com/StefanDobrev/Posts/08-08-04/IntelliSense_for_Expression_Blend.aspx"
    >Stefan Dobrev</a> has written an 
    <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/BlendSense">addin to 
    provide XML autocompletion</a> for the as yet unreleased Expression 
    Blend 2.5. This addin uses the XML Editor code from Kaxaml to 
    provide the autocompletion. Stefan has modified this code slightly 
    to add support for the Expression Blend&apos;s code editor.</p>

    <p>With <a href="http://build.sharpdevelop.net/BuildArtefacts/">
    SharpDevelop 3.1</a> you can now debug IronPython code with the 
    IronPython Interpreter (ipy.exe).</p>

    <p>Before you start make sure the debugger is set to use the 
    <b>Just My Code</b> feature. From the Tools menu select Options and 
    then click the Debugging category.</p>

    <p><img alt="Debugger options for debugging IronPython code"

    <p>Ensure that the <b>Just My Code</b> feature is checked and that 
    the <b>Step over code without symbols</b> is not checked. If the 
    Step over code without symbols option is selected then stepping 
    will not work properly and lines of code will be skipped over.</p>

    <p>There are two ways to debug your code. You can use the Python 
    menu or modify the project options. We will look at both of these 
    alternatives. First open your IronPython project into SharpDevelop. 
    Open your main file and make sure it is the active text editor 
    window. Set a breakpoint somewhere in your code. Then from the 
    Python menu select Run.</p>

    <p><img alt="Python menu option to run with debugger"
     src="Images/PythonRunWithDebuggerMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>This will start ipy.exe which will run your code and the 
    debugger should stop the execution at the breakpoint.</p>

     src="Images/DebuggingIronPythonCode.png"/></p>

    <p>From this point you can do the usual debugging activities such 
    as stepping through your code, viewing the callstack, adding items 
    to the watch window, etc.</p>

    <p>If you want to use a different ipy.exe then this can be 
    specified in the Python Options dialog (Tools menu | Options).</p>

     src="Images/PythonToolsOptionsDialog.png"/></p>

    <p>To enable debugging when you press F5 or select the Debug Run 
    menu option you can modify the project options. From the Projects 
    menu select Project Options and then open the Debug tab. Here you 
    should change the Start Action to <b>Start external program</b> and 
    use the browse button to locate ipy.exe. In the Start Options add 
    the following command line arguments, changing the name of your 
    main file as required.</p>

    <pre>-D ${ProjectDir}\Program.py</pre>
    <p>Once these changes are saved you can then press F5 and ipy.exe 
    will be run under the debugger instead of running the compiled 
    executable.3</p>

    <h2>Issues</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>No support for debugging the executable produced by the 
      IronPython compiler since it does not produce debug symbols (i.e. 
      .pdb files).</li>

      <li>

        When using ipy.exe you need to add references to .NET 
        assemblies explicitly in your code except for System which is 
        included by default. For example:
        <pre>import clr 
clr.AddReference(&quot;System.Windows.Forms&quot;) 
</pre>
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Thanks</h2>

    <p>Thanks to 
    <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/dsrbecky/">David 
    Srbecky</a>, SharpDevelop&apos;s debugger expert and maintainer, 
    for reviewing the code changes I wanted to make to the debugger and 
    making sure nothing was broken. Adding support for debugging 
    IronPython was straightforward and required 10-15 lines of new code 
    thanks to the code already written by David.</p>

    <p>Thanks also to <a href="http://devhawk.net/">Harry Pierson</a> 
    (IronPython Program Manager at Microsoft) who has written a great 
    set of blog posts on 
    <a href="http://devhawk.net/CategoryView,category,Debugger.aspx">
    creating an IronPython debugger in IronPython</a> which gave me the 
    reason why SharpDevelop&apos;s debugger was not working when 
    debugging IronPython code.</p>

    <p>Support for designing Windows Forms in IronPython is now 
    available in SharpDevelop 3.1. The 
    <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2007/10/21/IronPythonIntegrationInSharpDevelop22.aspx">
    original IronPython forms designer</a> was removed when 
    SharpDevelop 3.0 began supporting 
    <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython">IronPython 2.0</a> 
    which had removed support for generating IronPython code from 
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y2k85ax6.aspx">
    Microsoft&apos;s CodeDOM</a>. The forms designer has now been 
    re-implemented to use the IronPython 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">
    abstract syntax tree</a> (AST) and no longer relies on the 
    CodeDOM.  </p>

    <h2>Creating a Windows Application</h2>

    <p>To create a Windows Application open up the new project dialog 
    by selecting <b>New</b> then <b>Solution</b> from the <b>File</b> 
    menu. Select the Python category to show the available project 
    templates. Select the Windows Application project template, enter a 
    name and location and click the Create button.</p>

    <h2>Designing Windows Forms</h2>

    <p>The Windows Forms designer is not yet complete so be warned that 
    it could generate form code that will no longer compile.</p>

    <p>The designer can be opened by opening a form in the text editor 
    and selecting the Design tab at the bottom of the editor.</p>

    <p><img alt="Python main form before opening the designer"

    <p>Once open in the designer you can add controls to the form by 
    dragging the controls from the Tools window. In the screenshot 
    below a label, text box and a button have been added.</p>

    <p>Click the Source tab at the bottom of the editor to view the 
    generated code in the InitializeComponents method.</p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>

    <p>The IronPython forms designer is not yet complete and the 
    following are some of the known limitations.</p>

    <ol>

      <li>No support for project or local form resources.</li>

      <li>No support for icons.</li>

      <li>Incomplete support for ToolStripItems and menu strips.</li>

      <li>Incomplete support for ListViewItems.</li>

      <li>No support for TreeViewItems.</li>

      <li>Incomplete support for non-visual components (e.g. 
      Timers).</li>

      <li>Controls needed to be fully namespace qualified.</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Forms Designer Internals</h2>

    <p>For those interested in how the forms designer actually works at 
    a high level we will now look at what the IronPython forms designer 
    does when loading and then generating code for a form. </p>

    <p>To show the form in the designer the following steps are 
    executed.</p>

    <ol>

      <li>The form&apos;s code is parsed and an IronPython AST 
      (PythonAst object) is created.</li>

      <li>The AST is then visited and each control is added to the 
      forms designer and the control&apos;s properties are set.</li>

      <li>The form&apos;s properties are set in the designer and the 
      form is displayed.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>To generate the code after the form has been designed the 
    following steps are executed.</p>

    <ol>

      <li>The form is obtained from the forms designer.</li>

      <li>Each of the child components of the form have their 
      properties checked to see if they need to be serialized. This can 
      be done by getting all the 
      <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.typedescriptor.getproperties.aspx">
      property descriptors</a> and then checking the 
      <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.propertydescriptor.shouldserializevalue.aspx">
      ShouldSerializeValue</a> method. If they do need to be serialized 
      then code is generated for them and added to a StringBuilder.</li>

      <li>After all the child components are added the code for the 
      form is generated.</li>

      <li>Finally the generated code is inserted into the text editor 
      inside the InitializeComponent method, replacing any existing 
      code.</li>

    </ol>

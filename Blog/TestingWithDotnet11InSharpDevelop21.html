    <title>Testing with .NET 1.1 in SharpDevelop 2.1</title>

    <p>SharpDevelop 2.1, as of revision 2135, now allows you to run 
    your unit tests against .NET 1.1 or .NET 2.0.</p>

    <p>Which framework your tests are run under is determined by the 
    target framework your test project. So if you choose .NET 1.1 as 
    your target framework, your tests are run in the .NET 1.1 
    framework. The project&apos;s target framework can be set by 
    selecting <b>Project Options</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu, then 
    opening the <b>Compiling</b> tab.</p>

    <p><img alt="Target framework options"

    <p>Only .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0 are supported, so if you choose 
    another framework, such as one of the Compact Frameworks or Mono 
    SharpDevelop will run your unit tests under .NET 2.0.</p>

    <p>There&apos;s currently no support for Mono because our modified 
    nunit-console has a threading problem which happens very frequently 
    under Mono, but never seems to occur under Microsoft&apos;s .NET 
    Framework.</p>

    <h2>Running under another .NET Framework</h2>

    <p>Since SharpDevelop recently moved to using nunit-console to run 
    unit tests it was a fairly simple task to make it possible to test 
    against .NET 1.1 or .NET 2.0. It is straight forward because 
    nunit-console can be compiled against .NET 1.1. Since SharpDevelop 
    is launching nunit-console as a separate process we could have used 
    one of the following to target one particular framework.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>app.config</li>

      <li>COMPLUS_Version environment variable</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>App.Config</h2>

    <p>Using an app.config file is the most obvious and well documented 
    way to target a particular framework and is actually how 
    SharpDevelop gets nunit-console to target the different 
    frameworks.</p>

    <p>To run unit tests with .NET 1.1 we have nunit-console.exe built 
    against .NET 1.1 and an app.config file, called 
    nunit-console.exe.config which, contains the following:</p>

    <div id="xml">

      <pre>&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;!--  
        The startup section may be used to specify the runtime versions supported 
        in the order that they will be used if more than one is present.
    --&gt; 
    &lt;startup&gt; 
        &lt;supportedRuntime version=&quot;v1.1.4322&quot; /&gt; 
    &lt;/startup&gt; 
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    <p>Note that the actual nunit-console&apos;s actual app.config has 
    some extra things which I have removed in the above example so it 
    just shows what is needed to target a particular framework. The &lt;
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpgenref/html/gnconSupportedRuntimeElement.asp"
    >supportedRuntime</a>&gt; element is used to determine which 
    framework the application is run against.</p>

    <p>To run against .NET 2.0 we use the same copy of nunit-console, 
    built against .NET 1.1, but with an app.config which has .NET 2.0 
    as the supported runtime. When you run the unit tests SharpDevelop 
    looks at the project&apos;s target framework and runs the 
    corresponding nunit-console.</p>

    <p><b>COMPlus_Version</b></p>

    <p>With Microsoft&apos;s .NET framework you can set the 
    COMPlus_Version environment variable before running your .NET 
    application to run it under a particular framework. So at the 
    command line you could execute</p>

    <p><b>SET COMPLUS_Version=v1.1.4322</b></p>

    <p>Then your application would run against .NET 1.1. Specifying a 
    framework in your app.config will override the COMPLUS_Version 
    setting however.</p>

    <p>SharpDevelop does not use this method since using an app.config 
    makes it easy to support running unit tests with 
    <a href="http://ncover.org">NCover</a> and the debugger. Using 
    COMPLUS_Version we could not run NCover since it is compiled 
    against .NET 2.0. The debugger would also need to be modified so it 
    could set environment variables before debugging an application.</p>

    <h2>Mono</h2>

    <p>How do we target another framework with Mono? You can use one of 
    the following:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>app.config</li>

      <li>mono.exe --runtime command line parameter</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Again we can use the app.config file as discussed previously. We 
    can also use the new <b>--runtime</b> command line parameter that 
    was added in Mono 1.2.2. This works in a similar way to the 
    COMPLUS_Version environment variable allowing you to set the 
    framework version globally. Using the command line</p>

    <p><b>mono --runtime=v1.1.4322 nunit-console.exe</b></p>

    <p>would run nunit-console under Mono&apos;s .NET 1.1 framework.</p>

    <p>There is one difference though, specifying the target framework 
    in the app.config does not override this command line setting.</p>

    <h2>Code Coverage with .NET 1.1</h2>

    <p>If you want to look at code coverage when running your unit 
    tests under .NET 1.1 you will need to use 
    <a href="http://ncover.org/SITE/files/4/ncover_setup/entry202.aspx">
    NCover version 1.5.4</a> since the latest release 1.5.5 does not 
    work produce any coverage results when profiling a .NET 1.1 
    assembly.</p>

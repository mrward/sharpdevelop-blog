    <p>The <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/release-notes/nuget-1.4">
    NuGet 1.4 release</a> included some great new features for managing 
    NuGet packages across a solution. SharpDevelop has now been updated 
    to NuGet 1.4 so let us take a look at the changes in the 
    <a href="http://build.sharpdevelop.net/BuildArtefacts/#SD41">latest 
    version of SharpDevelop</a>.</p>

    <h2>Manage Packages Dialog</h2>

    <p>The first thing that you will notice is that the menu name has 
    changed. When you right click on a project or a solution you now 
    select <b>Manage Packages</b> to open the <b>Manage Packages 
    dialog</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="Manage packages right click context menu"
     src="Images/ProjectsWindowManagePackagesContextMenu.png"/></p>

    <p>The dialog name has changed and now shows the name of the 
    project or the solution in the its caption. Opening the dialog by 
    right clicking on a project and selecting <b>Manage Packages</b> 
    allows you to add or remove NuGet packages from the selected 
    project. In the screenshot below the MyApplication.Tests project 
    was selected when the Manage Packages dialog was opened.</p>

     src="Images/ManagePackagesDialogMyApplicationTestsProjectSelected.png"/></p>

    <p>Right clicking on the solution and selecting <b>Manage 
    Packages</b> allows you to add or remove NuGet packages from 
    multiple projects in one step. In the screenshot below the 
    MyApplication solution was selected when the <b>Manage Packages 
    dialog</b> was opened.</p>

    <p>
    <img alt="Manage Packages dialog - MyApplication solution selected"
     src="Images/ManagePackagesDialogMyApplicationSolutionSelected.png"/></p>

    <p>NuGet packages can now be added to multiple projects in one 
    step. Find the NuGet package you want to add and click the 
    <b>Manage</b> button. You will then be prompted to select which 
    project you want the package to be installed into.</p>

     src="Images/ManagePackagesSelectProjectsDialog.png"/></p>

    <p>Click the OK button to install the package into the selected 
    projects.</p>

    <p>To remove a NuGet package from multiple projects switch to the 
    <b>Installed</b> packages tab, select the package and click the 
    <b>Manage</b> button. You will then be shown a list of projects. To 
    remove a package uncheck one or more projects and click the OK 
    button.</p>

    <h2>Update-Package PowerShell Command</h2>

    <p>The Update-Package PowerShell command has been changed to 
    support updating a NuGet package across multiple projects. The 
    following commands can be used in the <b>Package Management 
    Console</b> window to update packages across projects.</p>

    <h3>Update all Packages in the Solution</h3>

    <pre>update-package</pre>
    <h3>Update all Packages in a Project</h3>

    <pre>update-package -ProjectName MyProject</pre>
    <h3>Update a Package across the Solution</h3>

    <pre>update-package jQuery</pre>
    <p>That covers the changes in the current version of SharpDevelop. 
    Note that not all of the features that were added in NuGet 1.4 are 
    currently available in SharpDevelop. For example, the Package 
    Visualiser and the safe updating of NuGet packages using 
    Update-Package -Safe, have not been implemented.</p>

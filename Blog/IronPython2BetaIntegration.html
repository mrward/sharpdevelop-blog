    <p>Support for 
    <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=14353"
    >IronPython 2.0 Beta 4</a> is now available with SharpDevelop 3.</p>

    <h2>Missing Features</h2>

    <p>Some of the features have been disabled compared to the 
    <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2007/10/21/IronPythonIntegrationInSharpDevelop22.aspx"
    >IronPython integration in SharpDevelop 2</a>.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Forms designer</li>

      <li>C# and VB.NET code conversion to Python</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Both of the above features involve converting code to and from a 
    Code DOM. Support for the Code DOM is reduced in IronPython 2 so 
    the above features have been temporarily disabled.</p>

    <h2>Compiling</h2>

    <p>IronPython 2.0 beta 4 re-introduced support for compiling python 
    code to a .NET executable or dll and so SharpDevelop supports this. 
    There is however one limitation. The working folder needs to be set 
    to the folder containing the compiled dll or executable otherwise 
    it will not be able to locate any local assembly references that 
    are not in the GAC, for example IronPython.dll.</p>

    <h2>IronPython Console</h2>

    <p>There&apos;s now an IronPython console which can be used to type 
    in IronPython expressions and have them evaluated interactively. It 
    is currently missing code completion which will be implemented 
    shortly. From the <b>View</b> menu select <b>Tools</b> and then 
    <b>Python Console</b>.</p>

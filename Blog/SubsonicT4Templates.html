    >SharpDevelop 4.2</a> now supports SubSonic T4 templates. 
    <a href="http://subsonicproject.com/">Subsonic</a> is an open 
    source 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">
    object-relational mapper</a> and makes use of T4 templates in all 
    but one of its supported methods to provide access to your data. 
    Before we take a look at what new T4 features were added to 
    SharpDevelop to support SubSonic let us see what you need to do to 
    get everything working.</p>

    <h2>Using SubSonic T4 Templates with SharpDevelop</h2>

    <p>In order to use the SubSonic T4 templates with SharpDevelop you 
    need to make two modifications to the Settings.ttinclude file.</p>

    <p>Replace the EnvDTE assembly reference:</p>

    <pre>&lt;#@ assembly name=&quot;EnvDTE&quot; #&gt;</pre>
    <p>With the following:</p>

    <pre>&lt;#@ assembly name=&quot;$(addinpath:ICSharpCode.PackageManagement)PackageManagement.dll&quot; #&gt;</pre>
    <p>This references SharpDevelop&apos;s NuGet addin assembly which 
    implements its own version of the Visual Studio object model.</p>
    
    <p>In SharpDevelop 4.3 an extra assembly directive is needed, as shown below:</p>
    <pre>&lt;#@ assembly name=&quot;SharpDevelop.EnvDTE.dll&quot; #&gt;</pre>

    <p>Add a new import directive as shown below:</p>

    <pre>&lt;#@ import namespace=&quot;EnvDTE = ICSharpCode.PackageManagement.EnvDTE&quot; #&gt;</pre>
    <p>This creates a namespace alias for EnvDTE so the references to 
    the Visual Studio object model in the SubSonic T4 template will 
    work.</p>
    
    <p>In SharpDevelop 4.3 the EnvDTE import directive does not need to be changed.</p>

    <p>All that is left now is to save the changes made to the 
    Settings.ttinclude file and generate the database access code by 
    executing the ActiveRecord.tt, Context.tt and Struct.tt T4 
    templates. This can be done by right clicking them in the Projects 
    window and selecting Execute Custom Tool.</p>

    <p>Now we will take a look at the new features that made this 
    possible.</p>

    <h2>Referencing SharpDevelop Properties and Environment Variables 
    in T4 Templates</h2>

    <p>The T4 assembly and include directives now support the 
    $(PropertyName) syntax to use SharpDevelop properties such as 
    SolutionDir and ProjectDir.</p>

    <pre>&lt;#@ assembly name=&quot;$(ProjectDir)lib\MyLibrary.dll&quot; #&gt; 
&lt;#@ include file=&quot;$(SolutionDir)Templates\MyTextTemplate.tt&quot; #&gt; </pre>
    <p>The assembly and include directives also support environment 
    variables through the %EnvironmentVariableName% syntax.</p>

    <pre>&lt;#@ assembly name=&quot;%ProgramFiles%\lib\MyLibrary.dll&quot; #&gt; 
&lt;#@ include file=&quot;%HOMEPATH%\MyTextTemplate.tt&quot; #&gt;</pre>
    <p>This new feature also supports the addinpath property and is 
    used to allow a T4 template to reference SharpDevelop&apos;s NuGet 
    addin using the $(addinpath:AddIn-ID) syntax which is expanded to 
    the directory containing the addin.</p>

    <h2>Accessing the SharpDevelop IDE from a T4 Template</h2>

    <p>The SubSonic T4 templates use the Visual Studio object model to 
    find the project&apos;s app.config file and read the database 
    connection string stored here in order to access your database. To 
    support this the T4 templating host in SharpDevelop now implements 
    the IServiceProvider interface which allows you to access 
    SharpDevelop&apos;s implementation of the Visual Studio object 
    model.</p>

    <p>To access the Visual Studio object model you set the T4 template 
    so it is host specific:</p>

    <pre>&lt;#@ template language=&quot;C#&quot; hostspecific=&quot;true&quot; #&gt;</pre>
    <p>Then you can access the DTE object, which is the top-level 
    object of the Visual Studio object model, as shown below.</p>

    <pre>&lt;#
    IServiceProvider provider = (IServiceProvider)Host; 
    EnvDTE.DTE dte = (EnvDTE.DTE)provider.GetService(typeof(EnvDTE.DTE));
#&gt;</pre>
    <p>The Visual Studio object model is not fully implemented in 
    SharpDevelop so you may run into problems if you make extensive use 
    of this object model.</p>

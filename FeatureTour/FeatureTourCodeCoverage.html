    <p>How much of your code is being actually being tested? 
    SharpDevelop can use 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/partcover/">PartCover</a> 
    (an open source code profiler) to profile your code whilst the unit 
    tests are being run and show you what parts of your code are 
    covered.</p>

    <p>Checking code coverage whilst running your tests can be done 
    from the <b>Unit Tests</b> window by right clicking a test class or 
    method and selecting <b>Run with code coverage</b>. This menu 
    option is also available when you right click a test method or test 
    class in the source code editor.</p>

    <p>Whilst running the tests with code coverage any output from 
    PartCover will be displayed in the <b>Output</b> window. After the 
    test run is completed any failing tests will be displayed in the 
    <b>Errors</b> window.</p>

    <p>To see a summary of the code coverage results, from the 
    <b>View</b> menu select <b>Tools</b> and then select <b>Code 
    Coverage</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="View code coverage menu item"
     src="../Help/Images/ViewCodeCoverageMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>This opens the <b>Code Coverage</b> window.</p>

    <p>The <b>Code Coverage</b> window shows the percentage code 
    coverage for classes and methods. Double clicking a class or method 
    will open up the corresponding source file. Double clicking a row 
    in the list view will open up the corresponding source file and 
    move the cursor to the appropriate line. The toolbar button 
    <img alt="Show code coverage button"
     src="Images/FeatureTourShowCodeCoverageButton.png"/> in the top 
    left corner of the <b>Code Coverage</b> window allows you to enable 
    or disable the highlighting of the covered source code in the 
    editor. This option is also available when you right click inside 
    the text editor.</p>

    <p><img alt="Show code coverage context menu"
     src="../Help/Images/ShowCodeCoverageContextMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>With this option enabled, the source code editor will highlight 
    the lines of code that have been covered in green, and uncovered 
    lines in red.</p>

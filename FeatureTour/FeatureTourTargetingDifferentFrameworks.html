    <title>Targeting Different Frameworks</title>

    <p>SharpDevelop has the ability to compile your code against 
    previous versions of Microsoft&apos;s .NET Framework, 
    Microsoft&apos;s Compact Framework or 
    <a href="http://mono-project.com">Mono</a> (an open source 
    implementation of the .NET Framework sponsored by 
    <a href="http://www.novell.com">Novell</a>) if they are installed. 
    Currently it is only possible to target different frameworks with 
    C# or VB.NET applications.</p>

    <p>From the <b>Project</b> menu select <b>Project Options</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="Project options menu item"
     src="../Help/Images/ProjectOptionsMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>Open the <b>Compiling</b> tab and select the desired framework 
    from the <b>Target Framework</b> drop down list.</p>

    <p><img alt="Selecting the target framework"
     src="Images/FeatureTourTargetingDifferentFrameworks.png"/></p>

    <p>Once the target framework has been selected you will get code 
    completion for that particular framework.</p>

    <p>When targeting a previous framework version there are a few 
    limitations that you should be aware of. The Forms Designer will 
    generate code and resources that are .NET 2.0 specific. Resource 
    files (.resx) will use .NET 2.0 types when compiled into your 
    assembly.</p>

    <h2>Cross Platform Development</h2>

    <p>Whilst Microsoft&apos;s .NET Framework only runs on Windows, the 
    <a href="http://mono-project.com">Mono</a> framework supports 
    Linux, Mac OS X, Sun Solaris, BSD and Microsoft Windows. Mono has 
    its own implementation of Microsoft&apos;s System.Windows.Forms, 
    which is not quite 100% feature complete, at least for .NET 2.0, 
    but is still under active development. Another alternative is to 
    use Gtk# or Glade# to create a cross platform GUI application. 
    SharpDevelop provides Gtk# and Glade# project and file templates. 
    To design the UI you can use the Glade designer that ships with 
    Mono.</p>

    <p>To target Mono, open the project&apos;s <b>Compiling</b> options 
    and select either <b>Mono 1.1</b> or <b>Mono 2.0</b> from the 
    <b>Target Framework</b> drop down list. With <b>Mono 1.1</b> 
    selected Mono&apos;s Mcs compiler will be used. With <b>Mono 
    2.0</b> selected Mono&apos;s Gmcs compiler will be used.</p>

    <p>In order to run your application under Mono, the project needs 
    to be configured. From the project options, open the <b>Debug</b> 
    tab, switch the <b>Start Action</b> to <b>Start external 
    program</b> and enter the path to the Mono executable, and finally 
    set the <b>Command line arguments</b> to <b>${TargetPath}</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="Debug options set to run under Mono"
     src="Images/FeatureTourRunningUnderMono.png"/></p>

    <p>To run your application under Mono, from the <b>Debug</b> menu 
    select <b>Run without debugger</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="Run without debugger menu option"
     src="../Help/Images/DebugRunWithoutDebuggerMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>Code built using Mono&apos;s compilers cannot be debugged on 
    Windows. The Mono compilers create their own open source debugging 
    symbols binary (.mdb) which SharpDevelop&apos;s debugger does not 
    support. There is also no Mono debugger available for Windows. In 
    order to debug a Mono application it needs to be built using the 
    Microsoft&apos;s C# compiler.</p>

    <p>SharpDevelop supports assemblies that reside in Mono&apos;s GAC. 
    From the <b>Project</b> menu select <b>Add Mono Reference</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="Adding a Mono Reference menu option"
     src="../Help/Images/ProjectAddMonoReferenceMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>This will open the <b>Add Reference</b> dialog box where a Mono 
    GAC entry can be selected and added to the project.</p>

    <p><img alt="Add Mono Reference dialog"
     src="../Help/Images/AddMonoReferenceDialog.png"/></p>

    <p>There is no support for the generation of Makefiles that would 
    be required to build the source code on non-Microsoft platforms, so 
    other tools would need to be used.</p>

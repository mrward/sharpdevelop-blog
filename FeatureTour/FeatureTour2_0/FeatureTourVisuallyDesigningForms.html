    <p>SharpDevelop has a forms designer that allows you to visually 
    design forms and user controls written in C#, VB.NET or Boo.</p>

    <h2>Opening the Forms Designer</h2>

    <p>To open the forms designer click the <b>Design</b> tab at the 
    bottom of the form&apos;s source code window.</p>

    <p><img alt="Click the Design tab to open the forms designer"
     src="Images/FeatureTourOpeningTheFormsDesigner.png"/></p>

    <p><img alt="Forms designer opened"
     src="Images/FeatureTourFormsDesigner.png"/></p>

    <h2>Adding Controls</h2>

    <p>Controls can be added to the form from the <b>Toolbox</b> 
    window. From the <b>View</b> menu select <b>Tools</b>.</p>

    <p><img alt="View tools menu item"
     src="../Help/Images/ViewToolsMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p>This opens up the <b>Toolbox</b> window. The controls you can 
    add to the form exist in tabs inside the toolbox:</p>

    <p><img alt="Toolbox" src="Images/FeatureTourToolbox.png"/></p>

    <table title="Toolbox Forms Designer Tabs">

      <thead>

        <tr>

          <th>Tab</th>

          <th>Contents</th>

        </tr>

      </thead>

      <tr>

        <td>Component</td>

        <td>Displays a list of non-visual components that can be added 
        to your form (e.g. FileSystemWatcher, NotifyIcon and Timer). 
        These are added to the non-visual design area at the bottom of 
        the forms designer.</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

        <td>Custom Components</td>

        <td>Displays a list of Windows Forms Controls that are in the 
        current project, any referenced project or any referenced 
        assembly.</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

        <td>Data</td>

        <td>Displays a list of data objects that you can add to your 
        form (e.g. DataGridView, DataSet and OleDbConnection).</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

        <td>Windows Forms</td>

        <td>Displays a list of the standard Windows Forms Controls 
        (e.g. Button, ListView, TreeView and Label).</td>

      </tr>

      <tr />

    </table>

    <p>Click a tab to expand it and see what controls it contains. To 
    add a control to the form you can either drag it or draw it onto 
    the form. To drag, click the control with the left mouse button and 
    whilst holding down the left mouse button move the mouse to your 
    form, release the mouse button to drop the control onto your form. 
    To draw it onto your form, select the control in the toolbox window 
    by left clicking it with the mouse, no need to hold the button down 
    at this point, then click where you want the top left corner of the 
    control to be located on the form, then whilst holding the down the 
    left mouse button drag to where the bottom right corner of the 
    control should be located. Once on the form you can visually resize 
    it, change its location and modify its properties. In the 
    screenshot below a Button, TextBox and Timer have been added to the 
    form, with the Timer shown in the non-visual component area of the 
    forms designer.</p>

    <h2>Setting Properties</h2>

    <p>A control has properties that can be set at design time, 
    changing how the control looks and reacts (e.g. text, font and 
    background image on a button). These properties are displayed in 
    the <b>Properties</b> window. From the <b>View</b> menu select 
    <b>Properties</b> to open the <b>Properties</b> window.</p>

    <p><img alt="View properties menu item"
     src="../Help/Images/ViewPropertiesMenuItem.png"/></p>

    <p><img alt="Properties Window"
     src="Images/FeatureTourPropertiesWindow.png"/></p>

    <p>The properties are displayed for the currently selected control. 
    You can view properties from another control by selecting it in the 
    designer or selecting the name of the control in the drop down list 
    at the top of the <b>Properties</b> window.</p>

    <h2>Events</h2>

    <p>Each Windows Form control has events that you can catch and 
    respond to. To see the events a control exposes, select the control 
    in the designer and select the <b>Events</b> tab 
    <img alt="Form Events tab"
     src="Images/FeatureTourFormEventsTab.png"/> in the 
    <b>Properties</b> window.</p>

    <p><img alt="Form events"
     src="Images/FeatureTourFormEvents.png"/></p>

    <p>To generate an event handler, select the event in the 
    <b>Properties</b> window, enter a name, or leave it blank to accept 
    the default name, and then double click the property or press the 
    enter key. The forms designer will then create an empty event 
    handler method and switch to the form&apos;s source code ready for 
    you to type in your code. The screenshot below shows the code 
    generated for a button&apos;s Click event.</p>

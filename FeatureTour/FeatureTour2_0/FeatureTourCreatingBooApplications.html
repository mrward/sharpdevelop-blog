    <p>Boo is a .NET programming language, created by Rodrigo Barreto 
    de Oliveira, which has a similar syntax to Python. More information 
    about Boo can be obtained from its home page 
    <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org">http://boo.codehaus.org/</a>. 
    SharpDevelop has support for Boo by providing project and file 
    templates, code completion, source code syntax highlighting, and 
    the ability to build Windows Forms applications or console 
    applications written in Boo.</p>
